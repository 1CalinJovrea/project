Anything good has been done better before.

The few good things about this movie have all been done better in other
movies.I went into this film with an open mind. The first thing I believed was
that reviews had been too harsh on Kristen Stewart and I was willing to
give her a chance. Bad call. Snow White's primary expression for most
of the movie is a blank stare with her mouth hanging open. At one point
when She is armored up she delivers what is supposed to be a rousing
speech to the troops. Instead it was Kristen Stewart just shouting with
no passion and certainly no inspiration. There is also no chemistry
between Snow White and the Huntsman. In reality the only lead actor who
shows any charisma and actual development is the evil queen. There is
little to no development for any other characters, which manages to
even drag down Chris Hemsworth's role as the Huntsman.While the movie did have decent special effects, they aren't enough to
save the film and even they have been done better in other films. The
"action" sequences are sparse and fairly generic. I was very disappointed with this film. It had potential, but a bad
script and boring/non-existent acting on Stewart's part destroyed it.
If you want an actual captivating fantasy film, you'd be far better off
watching Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, or even the most
recent version of Alice in Wonderland. The movies listed actually have
a good script and good acting along with good fight sequences and
excellent special effects. There is simply nothing memorable about this
rendition of Snow White.
