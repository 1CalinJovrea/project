Duff: Defined

I had the pleasure of going to see the NYC premiere last night with my
sister and was pleasantly surprised. Mae Whitman's performance in this
film has set her up to be Hollywood's next breakout star. She brings so
much humor, wit and charm to the table that's going to make her fans
wanting more. Viewers will also identify with Mae's struggles in the film, as well as
the overall message. I think we could all agree that everyone has has a
DUFF in their friend group. DUFF doesn't always have to mean ugly or
fat (it can, but it doesn't always apply). One example of a DUFF can be
a friend that's always just kind of there in the friend group and makes
everyone else look better. Another example of a DUFF, which is similar
to Mae's character in the film, is the friend of the group that is
hilarious and makes everyone die laughing, but is rarely someone a guy
is attracted to or would be looking to date. There are different
dimensions to the term duff. No duff is the same.Every one person can have a little DUFF in them. Meaning, a flaw,
insecurities, etc. Overall, the film was funny, even a bit crude at
points, but also very touching. I'd definitely recommend it.
