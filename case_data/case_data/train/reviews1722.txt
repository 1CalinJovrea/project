"Sometimes you make choices and sometimes they make you." Mia has a
great and loving family. A boyfriend who is in love with her and she is
one step away from her dream of going to Juilliard. All that changes
after a car wreck leaves her alone and fighting for her life. Watching
her family and friends at the hospital and looking back over her life
she must decide to stay living and chase her dreams or let go and be
with her family. First thing I have to say is that while this is a sad
movie it wasn't as depressing as I was expecting. The movie did a
really good job of making it emotional without feeling forced. The
movie was able to stay away from becoming overly melodramatic or too
cheesy. On the other hand though the movie was a little generic in some
parts and you were able to see certain things coming. The whole movie
you are trying to guess whether she will stay or go and I had a feeling
that the choice would make or break the movie. I could see points for
both sides and I have to say that I thought the ending was perfect.
Overall, a movie that wasn't cheesy but it was a little generic in some
parts. The ending was perfect and really helped the movie. This was
better then I was expecting. I give it a B.
