Cheese smothered in bad music covered in more cheese

This sad, silly attempt to bring back musicals is as lame as you could
imagine. The fact that it is set in the 80's and filled with every over
played hit from that era makes it even worse. I went to high school in
the 80's and there was a reason we all listened (except for a few
exceptions) to much older, better music. The amount of talent in this
film is far outweighed by the corny "burst into song" cringe worthy
intro into each new tune. I found myself laughing out loud. The plot is
so simple and clich√© it's not worth mentioning. Cruise is actually the
only entertaining thing about this but that is not saying much. The
80's were not a great time and only 45 year old chicks would want to
relive it channeled through Bon Jovi and Journey.
