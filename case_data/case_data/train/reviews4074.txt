Good Flick

I will be short and sweet (kind of like the film was) and won't go into
a summary as the rest of the well-written and accurate summaries have
been thus far. I thought this film was really good. The casting was
great, as was the plot and story line. It was a touching story, where
despite the indiscretions of a married couple, you had them rooting for
each other to find their way back to each other and to bring their
family together.The movie went fast and even though you hoped for a happy ending, you
weren't quite sure how it was going to turn out. I won't spoil it, but
the ride to the end was worth it. It is a cute, summer drama that is
worth checking out.
