'80s nostalgia with modern visuals

It feels almost inaccurate to refer to this movie as The Guest when in
reality it was entirely carried by a wonderful performance by Dan
Stevens. I enjoyed it thoroughly, which isn't at all to say it's what I
would normally call a good movie. The movie is highly campy,
reminiscent of '80s-'90s action movies / thrillers, and Dan Stevens
brings in an excellent all around tongue in cheek tough 80's anti-hero
performance. Stevens' acting is well matched by strong action that is to the point
and not drawn out, as well as superbly chosen music, particularly in
the climactic scenes. For any gamers out there, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon for
the nostalgia and humor, you'll likely love this movie as much as I
did.
