Nearly 2 hours of my life i will never get back

Normally I don't bother writing reviews of films I have watched, but in
the case of this one, I felt compelled to put fingers to keyboard.The premise of the film is quite good, in the fact that the purge has
been going on for several years, and a senator who's family were on the
receiving end of it several years earlier is making a stand against the
establishment to bring an end to the Purge once and for all. I
immediately thought I would enjoy the film, as the underdog scenario
can be quite good.The writing and characters - After a promising start, things went rapidly downhill, and continued on
a downward spiral, with characters I found it difficult to even try and
find some empathy for. From the senator who won't do as her security
team advise, to a KKK(?) presence which goes from being super efficient
(they are able to head shot from a distance) to almost keystone cops
(think the shooting scenes from naked gun where the police and the bad
guys are about 3 feet from each other and hiding behind a bench and a
bin but unable to hit each other), and a teenage girl who tries to
steal a bar of chocolate but gets caught, and then comes back to
"purge" the shop owner and get the previously mentioned bar of
chocolate (at this point, it would appear that it was bring your kids
to work day, and the script writers may have taken a tea break and left
their teenagers in charge of the computers) with a group of about 7 or
8 friends (all heavily armed and wearing enough clothing for at most 2
of them).The main bad guys, in stereotypical style, are mainly white middle aged
men (there did appear to be a couple of women in the NFFA), and its
only thankful that they weren't English as well).Onto the plot -Where to start? Great idea, lots of potential, but completely gone awry
from about 5 minutes in. Instead of being tense and keeping you
guessing what was going to happen, you could step away from the film
for 10 minutes and know pretty much what had gone on. Following a basic
plot line with no twists which couldn't have been guessed - teenager
coming back to purge the shop for the chocolate bar, NFFA wanting to
get the senator and do her in themselves, someone in the senators
security team working for the NFFA etc etc, it spectacularly failed to
grip and entertain, whilst leaving it open for a fourth installment
(please, NOOOOOOOO)In summary - If you like boring sequels, this is probably the film for you, as it
stretches the franchise just that little bit too far for it to be
believable and entertaining (think the third and fourth outings of the
resident evil films)If you want a film which is entertaining and keeps you on the edge of
your seat wanting to find out what happens next, avoid this one, and
choose something like The Usual Suspects, Quarantine or The Purge (the
first one in the trilogy).
