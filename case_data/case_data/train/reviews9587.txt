Avoid like the T-virus plague

There are so many things wrong with this film that it's difficult to
know where to begin, but let's try:1. It's confusing2. It's confusing3. Did I say it's confusing? Well, it's confusing4. The acting. The acting in this film is so bad I'm sure it will be
shown in acting school as a warning. One exception is the big monster
thing, who I felt brought a sorely needed subtlety and pathos to the
character5. Someone says: "Synchronize watches"6. Someone says: "OK, let's do this"7. Almost every idea is an unoriginal one: the clones (Matrix), the
simulated environments (Truman Show), the angry zombies (Twenty Eight
Days Later), etc8. The gunfights. In a world of endless violence, do we really need
another Hollywood film with a fetishistic display of guns?9. It has a car chase in it...yawn10. It has females dressed in latex suits and fighting each
other...yawnThis film pretty much sums up the state of Hollywood in 2012: it is a
tired, unoriginal and ultimately cynical attempt to get your cash.
