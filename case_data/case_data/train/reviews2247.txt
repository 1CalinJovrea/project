Actors working to rule.....

Disappointing. A few good visuals, but hardly any story. The plot: an
ancient mummy gets a new lease of life. The actress playing the mummy
is quite good but Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe are awful. They play
themselves and most of the time seem half-hearted and bored,just going
through the motions to get a pay check. Lucky my vote is a generous:
3/10.
