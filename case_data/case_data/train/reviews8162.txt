Awful

I thought I was watching John Wick, but it felt more like Superman for
10 year olds.There is no story, no dialogue, nothing. It's one guy running around and killing 1000 people at the same time
while they cannot hurt him at all, of course. The childish font used
during the movie is as "cancerous" as emojis. I haven't seen such an awful movie in a long while.
