I Saved My 1 For This Film

I honestly can't imagine how anyone with a sense of good writing, good
directing, or good acting could ever think this movie is entertaining
past the humor of its flaws. Do you people have brains? These actors
may as well have had the script in their hands while shooting. It would
have made no difference. The only impressive "skills" displayed came
when the girl cries after AUGUSTUS (so pretentious)passes away. The only thing that kept me engaged in this movie after I had started
watching was the curiosity of which one dies first. There were points
when I was rooting for the death of them together just so the movie
would end.This review isn't coming from someone heartless. I admit that I teared
up when Hazel bawls her eyes out, but that doesn't make the movie good.
That just means I sympathize with someone who is crying. That says
nothing about the quality of the film. What happened IMDb? I can usually trust your ratings. I've never
written a review here before but when I saw that this was higher than
an 8, I had to say something.This is a weak tearjerker for the weak-minded.
