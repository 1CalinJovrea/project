Dreadful

I can't remember the last time I saw a film this bad.The special effects were horrendous, looking like puppets that weren't
used in 'Blade Runner' or 'Child's Play'. The sound effects sounded
like they'd been lifted from 'Gremlins'.The casting was appalling. I thought better of Toni Collette than to be
associated with something so poor.The visiting relatives were a clich√© of annoying movie stereotypes.
Unruly children with oblivious, self-possessed parents. The children
all soon grated but were pleasingly killed off.The main child characters role was predictable and quickly grew
tedious.At one point the window in the living room is smashed in, moments later
the remaining characters leave by the front door only for 'Omi' to lock
them out. They bang on the door asking to be let in before leaving her
to her fate, rather than climb through what was left of the window
nearby.This represents an hour and a half of my life I won't get back.Appalling.
