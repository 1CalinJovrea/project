Tries to be funny, but ends up being annoying instead.

What happened to Cameron Diaz, there was a time she was making descent
movies to watch and enjoy, like The Holiday(2006), My Sister's
Keeper(2009), and Knight and Day(2010) to name a few. Now it seems that
she seems to going in a steadily decline with such films like Bad
Teacher(2011), What To Expect When Your Expecting(2012), and now Sex
Tape.A happily married couple(Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal) feel that there
lives have reached a certain dullness, with there careers and kids, so
in hopes to spice things up, they send there kids to there grandma, in
hopes to have one great night of passion, they decide to make sex tape
for fun. Realizing the next morning, someone has text them saying they
loved there sex tape, and remembering they forgot to erase it, now it
has become a race a goofy race to keep it from getting out there?there was a good comedy just wanting to come out, but it never does.
This film instead portrays itself has the travesty that it is. I feel
bad for Diaz and Segal for being in this mess. There talks on sex and
having sex after a while becomes like a joke that keeps dragging itself
until it stops being funny. I was sitting in the theater wondering was
any of that supposed to be funny, I was left feeling confused. The
antics they get themselves into I have seen in better films. Segal and
Diaz do have chemistry, but it goes nowhere. Rob Lowe has a cameo, but
that also goes nowhere. Now Rob Cordry is the only who gave me a few
chuckles. What does that tell you when you can't get laughs with sex
and drugs, hire better writers.
