What A Delightful Movie!

Now this is the sort of movie Hollywood should be making! All the
talent in these older actors and actresses and it's being wasted by far
too many tasteless, unfunny, crude movies that you either do not want
to see, or if you are foolish enough to be roped into attending, you
regret with every inch of your soul. In this one, each and every part
was cast to perfection. A plot that made sense, fully fleshed out
characters you like, and just fun, fun, fun. Tell you, there were more
people in the matin√©e my friends and I went to see than for any movie
we can remember seeing in a long time. And all of us left the show
smiling. This one is a keeper. Would actually love to see a sequel to
this, set a year or so ahead. I can think of several older
actors/actresses to be in the film, in addition to these delightful
players. I'm hoping Hollywood is paying attention. Sometimes they do it
right and use the real talent. The Best Oriental Marigold Hotel was
one. Quartet was one. I could name a few more, too. And this is one.
Looking for a nice break in some of the bleak stuff being offered? Here
it is!
