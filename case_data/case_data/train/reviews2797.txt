Car Movie for Those who Love Cars and Hate Cartoonish BS

My title is my opening thesis. This movie is for those who love cars
and who's mind inhabits the real world. If you are looking for escapism
fantasy (I.E. Transporter, Fast n Furious) then look elsewhere.Frank Grillo turns in a gritty and convincing performance of a low
level criminal backed into a corner. The script does drag a bit during
the complicated set up (pun intended). It does however redeem itself in
the second act.The very sparse but effective cinematography is reminiscent of genre
classics such as "Thief". The movie is rather ambitious in that it is
shot almost entirely in or from the car (ala Hitchock's "Life Boat").Those who know what double shifting and an apex is, will find the
direction, editing and cinematography very engaging. If not, then it is
just some guy driving a car.
