Old Script, New Title

Stephanie introduces her boyfriend Laird to her family, namely her
overprotective father Ned(Cranston). Who is dismayed at his daughter as
he tries to absorb the reality that Laird is a part of his life now.
Stephanie is so blinded by love that she seems to overlook her
boyfriends obnoxious behavior. There are some original jokes, Yet, this
feels like an R-rated version of "Meet the Parents". Which, in my
opinion is a better film in every way. Don't take my word for it, see
it for yourself and decide.If you're going to remake a movie at least have the dignity to give it
the same name. What's peculiar is, it's made by the same people that
created "Meet the Parents". Which leads me to wonder, What were the
writers thinking? More importantly, What was the studio that approved
this film thinking? I'm usually open minded when it comes to comedies,
even if it's raunchy. However that doesn't mean that I will overlook
using recycled material and calling it a new brand.
