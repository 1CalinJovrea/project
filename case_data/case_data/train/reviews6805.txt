Do not waste your money!!!!.

Revenant was the worst movie I've ever seen. If you want to pay $7 to
watch almost 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping and breathing
heavily in the snow, it's the perfect movie for you.It was also really inaccurate as the dude Leo was playing was somehow
very literate and wrote in present day English. This would not have
been the case. it was really unnecessary to have this detail in it. The only enjoyable part for me was the symbolism of Leo's rebirth as he
was coming out of the horse that he was in due to the weather. I am only writing the last two things because i can't upload the first
paragraph unless i have 10 lines. But seriously. Do not waste your money on this movie. Pirate it if you
really wanna see it, but even then, it isn't even worth the time.
