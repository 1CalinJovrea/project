Flop In Their Eyes

Secret In Their Eyes is a movie that will break your heart for what it
could have been. The best part is the cast. Julia Roberts, Chiwetel
Ejiofor, and Nicole Kidman have garnered attention for their presence,
but we also have doing supporting duties Dean Norris, and Michael
Kelly. The film opens with the brutal death of Jess's daughter. The
moment Jess finds her daughter and the inexplicable grief that follows
is a shattering and powerful moment. The prosecution and how justice
will be parceled out to a police officer, a country, and ultimately a
parent is the crux of Billy Ray's third directorial effort. This case
which transcends from 2002 to 2015 fails to find its center through a
milquetoast romance between the characters of Ray and Claire. The
unrequited love and smoldering passion these two are supposed to feel
is not there, and the film falls through the center. Kidman never
settles fully into her role. Kidman, who excels in more offbeat work,
becomes a stoic non-entity in the film. Ray does not adequately
structure the transitions between time periods, nor do the actors
convey any change in demeanor and attitude to assist the audience. This
lack of emotional tension restricts the audience into a state of
indifference the film does not have the quality or tension to
transcend.
