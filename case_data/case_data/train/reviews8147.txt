Serviceable story, technically decent, but falls short

I really tried to like this movie. It had all of the elements of
success: a great cast, excellent production, and a solid premise.However, it just couldn't win me over and ultimately fell flat.The biggest beef I had with the movie, and admittedly this is a very
subjective matter, is that if you're going to make a movie like this,
the music must at least be good. I don't consider myself to be a music
elitist; I can appreciate most forms of music. However, the music
(presumably) written for the movie is bland and quickly forgettable.
I'm not sure what scene the music is trying to appeal to, but it seems
to me like all of it was written by committee, being as generic and
inoffensive as possible, all the while having no real melody.The story also suffered from poor writing in several spots. Plot
contrivances abound, and the end of the movie is equally puzzling and
underwhelming.
