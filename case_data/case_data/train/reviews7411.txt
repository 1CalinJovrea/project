A career-low for all involved

Inferno is the very definition of phoning it in. Everyone in this film
looks bored on the verge of tears and you can literally hear Ron Howard
off camera counting his money as he sobs into his pillow. No joke,
children, it's honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen.Tom Hanks once again returns as Robert Langdon but he left his talent
and emotion back at home. No one is here because they want to be. This
time he's caught up in an utter gibberish plot concerning a new
world-ending plague that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There
are more holes in this story than there are grains of sand in the
Sahara.A special mention of Felicity Jones' "acting ability" deserves its own
paragraph. This woman had a sub-Hollyoaks level of conviction. She's so
breathtakingly hollow and vacant. I have not ever seen such a
non-performance in an actual theatrically released film. How on Earth
is she expected to carry the next Stars Wars movie? She was beyond
beyond terrible.This is a movie that insults and condescends to it's audience at every
opportunity. It's not exciting and so far off the mark that it tries to
aim for. Inferno is plays out like a bad SyFy movie. I almost think
that everyone involved secretly hate Sony and intentionally made a
stinker.I chose seeing this over going to the Anime festival. What was I
thinking?
