Nothing compares to Juno!

To be honest I get the point of the director, but the movie was below
average. Nothing to do with Juno or Clueless (as the trailer displayed)
Truly being seventeen is not being totally selfish, mean, impolite,
irritating and unsympathetic! The story is about a self-adsorbed bitch
that in the last 5 minutes figures out that other people have problems
and that she should be a better person. Yeah if all the people in the
world got so many chances as you did and everyone was so forgiving!
Also the fact that sex is such a cool issue for a virgin so much that
she sends her crush(who thinks she is a loser with a capital L) a place
to do it, had me in laughing tears of what I am seeing. Oh yeah!
Sexting is a thing now and everyone has a pool in his house! Even if
these things do happen should a movie portray them like that? But the
only thing that saved this movie is the actors and the music! Woody
Harrelson is amazing as always and the only one that cracked some jokes
in this film! Hailee Steinfeld and Kyra Sedgwick do indeed give a very
good performance!
