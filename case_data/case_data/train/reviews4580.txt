Don't believe the hype

This movie has been made to entertain 12-15 year old. It's not very
good. Most of the jokes miss and the story isn't very good either. Seth
Rogan and James Franco are wasted on this film.I was cringing all the way through it. The jokes are totally infantile
and I can't remember laughing at any of them.This movie is best avoided. Unless of course you're under 15 years of
age.I've given it 1/10.Yes, it's truly awful.The publicity surrounding the movie mad me watch it.
