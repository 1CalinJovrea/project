"The Trailer Was Worth Watching" "The Movie Wasn't"

This was the type of movie that when you see the preview you say to
yourself "Wow, this looks like a good action/thriller". Unfortunately,
the trailer was much better than the actual movie.The Counselor was about a successful attorney who becomes newly
engaged, gets greedy, and decides to engage in the drug trafficking
business, which predictably leads to his downfall.There were so many different angles and characters in this movie, that
it was hard to keep track of the direction of this movie.Cameron Diaz gives an honest effort as the sleazy girlfriend, and she
actually plays that part to a tee, as in one scene she humps the
windshield of a vehicle(don't ask).Some of the scenes didn't make sense. In one scene a guy spends hours
in configuring a wire across a roadway where he was plotting to kill a
smuggler on a motorcycle. I guess the audience is supposed to assume
that no one- and I mean no-one, uses that roadway for a good portion of
the day.The same could be said about some of the characters in the movie. It
appeared as though The Counselor was asking the drug cartel leaders for
advice, and they would give these long philosophical speeches that
basically amounted to nonsense.All in all, I had high hopes for this movie, but came away
disappointed.
