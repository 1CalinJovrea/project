A Quick, Nutshell Opinion of "Paranorman"

Paranorman, the new stop motion animated film from Laika Studios is an
intriguing idea for a film that always falls just shy of its premise
thanks to a lackluster script and some occasionally jerky animation.
The film follows Norman, a lonely boy who can see and talk to ghosts.
When a Witch's Curse from back in the Puritan days brings zombies back
to life roaming Norman's town, it's up to Norman to save the day. The
best parts of the film are the jokes making stabs at classic horror
film clichés, such as the zombies being afraid of the humans trying to
kill them, rather than the other way around. As well, the examination
of bullying and its effects on children is handled fairly well through
Norman's journey in the film, but where the film falls short is in all
of the two-dimensional characters that surround Norman. All of the
characters that surround Norman are Hollywood movie clichés, the jock,
the bully, the dumb girl, etc. Then, add on to the fact that the
animation of the characters is often jerky, looking as if the animators
forgot to animate a few key frames, which in stop motion animation can
be headache inducing, and you have a so-so film.I give Paranorman a 4 out of 10!
