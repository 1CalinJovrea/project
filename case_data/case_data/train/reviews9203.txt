A simple comedy that does its job.

After reading many reviews, i have to agree that this is a technically
a bad film. The humor in this movie is very raw and crude (which
doesn't bother me), and it has a very simple storyline. I was ready to
give this movie a rating of a 5 or below until i stopped looking into
the movie too much, and saw it for what it is. The purpose of a comedy
is to make people laugh, and that is exactly what myself and the rest
of the theater did for the majority of the movie. The movie is so
relevant as well with the upcoming presidential elections, and i feel
this movie helps take the edge of the brutality of the current Obama
vs. Romney.If you just want to see a simple movie that will make you laugh without
having to think about the plot, then see the movie.
