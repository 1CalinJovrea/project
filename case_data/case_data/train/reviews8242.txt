Much better than i expected

Wow, i honestly did not expect much from this movie from the trailer.
The message seemed one dimensional, and the whole 'action' bit from the
trailer wasn't really that impressing. Only thing that dragged me to
the theater was the director's name (also the great cast), and i am
happy to say that i'm pleasantly blown away by director Bong once
again. The movie looked great, the first half was beyond thrilling, the
acting for the latter half was just, top notch, the action was bloody
and fantastic, and most of all, the ideology behind the story was
interesting to say at least. I can't really say anything more than that since saying anything beside
the trailer would be a dead giveaway, but really, wow. I honestly don't know how the director's unique style and choices would
get to the American audience, but as a person who enjoys this strange
and beautiful execution of director Bong, this movie fulfilled
everything i want from Bong's film an intellectual Sifi movie. It gave
me a handful amount of things to think and talk about, and those kinds
of movies always give me the best movie experiences. Definitely one of
the must watches of this year.
