Powdered milk genuine performance.

Michael Keaton gives an award worthy performance as burger mogul Ray
Kroc. The burgers sizzle as does Keaton who carries this story on his
back and keeps this bio pic extremely interesting.Kroc comes across as a ruthless devil as he eventually takes everything
from the original well acted burger brothers. The relationship with the
next wife Joan is played just subtle enough.The period look is outstanding. The cars, clothes, and people are
perfect. A great script well directed and acted makes for an excellent
movie.The movie is in limited release and doesn't need a big screen. It's a
small movie that will play well on home platforms. Even vegetarians
will sink there teeth into this juicy piece of story telling.
