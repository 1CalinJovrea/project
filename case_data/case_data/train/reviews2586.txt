Disappointing

The trailer for this film did it job and I was intrigued enough to
invest some time. The cinematography was off the mark and presented as
a low budget offering. More character development was needed and the
leading characters were miscast. The subject matter of the entire film
was based around was ridiculous presumption that an identical Iris
pattern indicates the same person reincarnated. On the presumption that
you will go along with this for entertainment value more disappointment
will await. It never felt like the film got moving and when it finishes
I would imagine you first thoughts will be 'Is that it? what a waste of
time' No inspiring acting, weak story line, not well executed and not
particularly well shot or edited. In one word 'Underwhelmed'
