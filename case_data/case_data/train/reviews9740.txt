I'm a big horror fan and this is the best little horror yarn I've seen
in ages.Well acted, with some recognisable faces. Brian Cox is great as the
small town coroner that leads the autopsy on the titular body, in one
scene he even managed to give me a sad lump in the throat which was an
unexpected feeling during an unnerving horror flick. Emile Hirsch plays
his son and assistant and though he's good doesn't have as much impact
as Cox. Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton) makes an appearance as the
town sheriff.Where this film really succeeds is in doing something a lot of modern
horror has forgotten about - it toys with the viewers imagination,
creating an uneasy feeling out of the narrative, half light, sound and
shadow. This is not to say you don't get to see anything grotesque or
unsettling, as certain scenes are not for the squeamish.I don't want to spoil the story but will say this, the resolution is
not quite as good as the build up. It's very hard for a horror film,
especially one that plays on fear and the imagination, to deliver a
conclusion that is suitably unsettling - this one half succeeds. But
the ride is more than worth it and the ending is far from a failure.If you like horror, watch this.
