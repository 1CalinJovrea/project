Magical, Mischievous and Wicked

Perhaps the biggest dilemma you will have before going into this, is
whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As
someone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking
this endeavor, I am pleased to say that I'm relieved, As Yates delivers
a refreshing and whimsical film. Sure, it doesn't have the characters
we've come to love, but with the creatures you encounter and with the
added humor of J.K Rowling, you will come to grip with the fact that
this movie will leave an impression.Newt is a scientist who has an uncanny resemblance to Doctor Who, as
his strange and cunning outlook bares the trademarks of the epic
character. Newt is searching for unorthodox creatures. As he stuffs
them into his suitcase which is an accident waiting to happen. The
suitcase seems to be unhinged and dire need of a proper lock. As he
arrives in New York he mixes his bag with Jacob Kowalski, who lets
loose beasts that start to run rampant in the streets. J.K. Rowling's
first outing as a screenwriter is a wild success, with her keen eye for
detail and whimsical taste. "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"
becomes a fine addition to her epic saga. I'm glad that there are four
more awaiting us because if Rowling proved anything, it's that she has
a lot more to offer.
