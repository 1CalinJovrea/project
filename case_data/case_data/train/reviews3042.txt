Very good

I read some of the people who wrote that the movie portrayed negativity
about "yellow people". These are people who view people only by color,
but act like they are standing up for them. Pitiful. The movie portrays
a condition that can exist anywhere and that has existed in almost
every country. The movie was a constant thrill. Pierce just keeps
getting better. We watched this on Thanksgiving with 6 of us an we all
loved it. One of the characteristics that make a big difference is the
costume dept. This movie captured every appropriate detail from hair to
teeth to dirt to blood. Well done. We also appreciated the editing.
Very nice flow between scenes where you always knew where you were
while watching.
