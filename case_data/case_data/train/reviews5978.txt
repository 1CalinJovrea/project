the world has gone mad

It is almost hard too put into words how bad this movie was: The plot
was virtually nonexistent , Most of the acting (bar Hardy and Theoren)
was absolutely diabolical ,The script was like a ten year old wrote it,
And Oh My God what was with that guy and the flaming guitar???Before you assume that I hate action films and that I am only giving
this movie a bad review because I hate action films. Your wrong. Action
is my favorite movie genre , and I was so excited to see this movie ,
but during the film I actually found myself checking my watch every
five or ten minutes because it dragged on for so long , and for what ?
Absolutely nothing.This is probably one of the worst action films I have ever seen in my
entire life and I do not recommend it too anybody. The only really good
thing about this movie was the visual effects , which where great.Final verdict : 3/10
