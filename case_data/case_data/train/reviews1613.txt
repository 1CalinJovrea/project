pushing the envelop

Helen is a rebellious teen skateboarder. She is deliberately unhygienic
to rebel against her unstable mother. Her parents are divorced. Her
mother has had many men and as many religions. Her father hurts her
unintentionally. Her best friend Corinna often makes poor choices in
boys. She accidentally cut herself while shaving causing an anal
fissure. Her hospitalization gives her an idea to reunite her parents
and then she falls for nurse Robin.This German film pushes the sexual envelop with some aggressive subject
matters. It doesn't shy away and lead actress Carla Juri is all too
happy to push. Some of it is funny and a lot of it is shocking. If it
doesn't offend, this movie actually delivers a compelling original
character. However, I bet many would be offended or at least find some
of this off-putting.
