Quite the Kroc...

This is one of those films where you squeeze your buttcheeks and grit
your teeth hoping to anything that it's not one great big commercial
for the Clown. Relax. It's not.Michael Keaton in the starring role was perfectly cast. He plays the
consummate salesman personality; charming, intelligent, fast- talking,
quick-slithering, and deleterious. He is eccentric, but not over the
top. It's easy to like him, easier to hate him. All along the film,
Keaton's portrayal of the betrayal is executed with perfect timing,
much thanks to an excellent script and a beautifully crafted period
setting. This, alone, would earn its star rating. Why it does not earn a perfect score, however, is because the subject
matter, though interesting, is a turn-off. The fast food industry is
under the gun for promoting childhood obesity, heart disease, and other
controversial social issues. The way the film advertises itself looks
like a promotion for the brand, rather than a story in history's
shadow. The first impression upon reading the synopsis, or looking at the promo
art, is "Who cares?" which most likely follows with, "Screw those
people!" What they should have done was promote the central character
and let the audience come to the realization of his significance during
the film. "The Founder" is not really about McDonald's. Why put the golden arches
in red and yellow to promote it? This is a fascinating car-wreck, all-American story that is neither
appealing or unappealing -- just is. However, it is also about all of
us. It's about what we allow as a culture and gives us a glimpse of who
is really behind the curtain when we seek the Wizard in our daily
lives, and it's very well done. And that's what makes it worth the
watch.
