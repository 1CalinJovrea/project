Sick from cheese

This film is horribly cheesy. Hollywood does cancer very very badly.
The male lead could not act and therefore I was not convinced and
therefore I did not cry. I cry at everything usually but this film is
not convincing at all. It was definitely the male lead that spoilt it
for me. I just didn't understand his naked obsession with the female
lead. From the minute he sets eyes on her, wham he is in love! I found
that very strange, or maybe it was just the way he did it. I know love
at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top. If you watch
Love Story from the 60's which features cancer, it has an authentic
love story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine
so you don't really care about the characters. To be frank, the whole
thing reeks of cheese. Stay away.
