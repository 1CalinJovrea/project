Not keen on the length of the film!

I was so glad to see the SNL cast were involved in this film including
Pete Davison, Vanessa Bayer, Leslie Jones and Bill Hader. However I
don't understand why they made this film longer because it really did
get boring in some scenes.Like any other normal person would do, I just skipped along the way to
the near ending. I don't mind Amy Schumer as a person but I thought her jokes were too
outdated like I know I only saw her the first time in this movie, but
still it was just a little corny reallyI wouldn't consider this a best movie for the SNL cast because pretty
much it went downhill for me I'm afraid!
