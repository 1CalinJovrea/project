This is a series that didn't need one sequel let alone 5, but if you have seen the others then you might at well watch this one.

"I want to meet these people and find out what I'm all about." Danny
(Iloot) has just found out that that he has inherited a mysterious
resort in West Virginia. Him and his friends decide to take the trip to
see what he has. When they arrive they meet Jackson and Sally (Katz)
who claim to be his relatives. What starts out as an exciting new
adventure take a deadly turn when family secrets are revealed.
So...what can I say about Wrong Turn 6? If you have seen the others
then you will know what to expect from this. There is a lot of gore and
cannibalism. So if that is your thing then you will love this. When
most horror franchises get into the 5th and 6th movies they turn more
comedic. This one hasn't done that yet, I'm not sure if that's a good
or a bad thing. What I do know is that this is a series that didn't
need one sequel let alone 5. Overall, if you have seen the others then
you might at well watch this one. I give this a C-.
