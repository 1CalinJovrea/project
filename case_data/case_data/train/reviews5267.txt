Needed something. Not good.

No, no, no. This is a movie about Mark Walberg being really really fit
and about bad jokes and bad CGI. Nothing more, nothing less. Five is
more than generous for this movie. It sucks seeing Will Ferell also,
making these lousy movies all the time. Get someone to write a decent
script and some nice jokes, for God's sake! The part where the motorcycle gets in the house and exits from the
window on the car, is not only unrealistic (Dah!) but it's also really
really bad CGI. This is where I first thought that the movie is utter
nonsense. Then, the skateboard incident came and I was like "the CGI
dude should really pay them back (if he wasn't just doing his practice,
straight out of school or something!). The story is interesting and there have been some moments in the movie
when it actually worked but there was no flow in there. The story was
interrupted constantly by moments of stupid humour or poor choices in
plot, not letting you get into it for more than five minutes. While it could have been a movie both serious but with some really nice
laughs, it was not. Mark Walberg is not the star actor, but I mean,
come on. Do you really need to be making these movies? Will Ferell is
beyond saving I think. He has not done a decent movie for quite a
while, sticking to similar concepts and almost always playing the same
character that has stopped being funny on so many levels.
