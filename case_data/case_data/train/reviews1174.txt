Got Pets? - Ya HAVE to see it! - Got Kids? - Ya HAVE to see it !

Fast-paced and Funny! Lots of Laughs and action ..... The good guys
always win! ..... This out does Disney by far Not too scary for kids,
scenes move and change fast, so their little minds don't really grasp
the couple of sad parts .....Attention is fixed on their Brooklyn
adventure underground .. Great voice-overs, each character comes
through as an individual, so you can pick your favorite "PAL"... Our
theater was full of laughter almost all the way through ... except when
the kids were cheering for the pets as they managed to outsmart Animal
Control .. It's always fun when a rag-tag group of mis-fits out smarts
the bad guys..Most of the pets are available through local toy stores
with the exception of "Tatoo" the pig ... why he is not included seems
to be an oversight on the part of the studio.. Not that he had a major
role but nonetheless he was still an intregal part to the plot No
matter which your favorite pet is in the movie, it was well written and
deserves to be seen by all
