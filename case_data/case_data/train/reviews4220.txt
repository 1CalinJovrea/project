I don't like sappy movies, but I really liked this sappy movie. Clarke wins again.

Emelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watched
this movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in that
role, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to see
what would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... free
as her dragons.There are a lot of solid things about this movie. The story (of a young
woman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the direction
and cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing also
good-not-exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer and
Charles Dance)and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotional
notes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cue
swelling, heartwarming music...), ring true enough for an unabashed
romance.So, not really my type of movie. But I am happy to say that I was
(almost) completely taken by Clarke's performance. Her character here
is nothing like her GoT role, but is in many ways an equally
fantasy-based role (but with clumsy shyness and striped leggings
instead of fireproof skin and dragons) -- and Clarke manages to pull
this character out of romantic fantasy into believability as
effectively as she brings to life her role as Mother of Dragons. She
has the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character-acting
chops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice, 7-of-10 heartwarmer
up to a 9-of-10 charmer.
