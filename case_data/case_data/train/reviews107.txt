Magic Mike XXL. Don't watch it: I'm doing you a favor.

I liked the first Magic Mike, I liked it a lot. I found it funny and
interesting. It was entertaining. I thought that Channing Tatum was a
really good dancer and, while watching, I regretted of not being a male
stripper myself (beautiful life, lot of girls, you know).But this one is terrible. Boring, depressing I wonder who could really
like it: girls? I doubt it. Men? Not a chance. I won't tell a word about the plot, as IMDb warns me not to do it. I
will only state my disappointment for the lack of an entertaining
story, a catching character or a good show. A terrible wasting of good
actors and time.
