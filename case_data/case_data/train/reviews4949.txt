The movie about boredom

If I had to name 10 most boring movies this one would be my first!
There is nothing happening in the movie even when little sister
arrives. We all can appreciate the effort that goes in to making a
movie and this is the only reason that I won't give the lowest score
possible. Is it romantic; yes OK but nothing special. Is it dark; yes
OK it is but it can be done much better. And that is the most annoying
thing about this movie. Everything is in the middle it is not a good
romance it is not a very dark movie and it sure as hell isn't a horror
movie, the drama part I can give to you.Also I am reading other reviews stating that the characters are well
rounded and easy to connect withÂ… I really didn't feel any connection
to any character they are all unclear because they have to be unclear
they are bored from life. This is probably the point to the movie. Acting is probably the best part but with all the boredom you have to
endure it really doesn't show as much What people see in this kind of
movie I will never understand? Also I probably won't understand what
Jim Jarmusch wonted to say with this film but it was probably nothing
in his mind also or he was bored!
