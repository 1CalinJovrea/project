You Will Not Like This Movie

The very definition of "not for everyone", Tusk is an oddball, absurd,
twisted midnight movie that plays more like a demented fever dream than
a horror or comedy film. I'd never recommend it to anyone I intend to
ever speak to again.Here are the reasons why you won't like it:1) It's unexpectedly surreal, with little interest in the laws of
reality, or at least modern medicine and police work. And it's not
directed in an obviously surreal, arty fashion like, say, a David Lynch
picture, which makes it even harder to wrap your head around.2) It's got an odd tone. There's comedy, sure, but it's mostly a
slower, more cringe- inducing variety than Kevin Smith is typically
known for. There's suspense, and a bit of gross-out, but the film
evokes more unease than outright scares, and the grotesqueries are more
evocative of a nightmare after eating one too many sliders than, say,
Saw. And it swings freely between the two with no warning at all.3) You haven't seen Tod Browning's "Freaks", a classic bit of cult
cinema that Smith has made references to in other films. In fact, you
probably don't even know it exists. (Cinephiles will notice rather
direct references to many of Kev-O's other favorite movies as well,
including Silence of the Lambs and Jaws.)4) You're Canadian, and your country and culture are No Laughing
Matter.If for some reason none of the above applies to you, may I recommend
"Tusk"? It's oddball, gonzo, at times self indulgent and slow, but also
occasionally very funny and strangely thought-provoking, provided
you're willing to go along for the ride. It'll make an
impression...especially if your short-term memory "isn't what it used
to be."
