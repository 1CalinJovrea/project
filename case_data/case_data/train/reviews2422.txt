will warm your heart

What a good film. And most impressive is that it is actually based on a
true story (sorry, I haven't done my research before the film, so when
the documentary bits came at the end, I was like No way, that was
actually for real!). I am not sure it can really be called a "feel
good" movie - life wasn't that easy for her. But it will certainly warm
your heart with a big and powerful message that we don't really need
much to be happy.Sally Hawkins was absolutely great. With that shy but ready smile and
wondering eyes. Although I felt kind of sorry for the way they
portrayed her husband. Not sure if he was as brute in real life as they
made him. Not that I know, of course, but it felt too much (and he
looked smiley enough in the documentary bits). Also, I'd say the
editing was not as smooth as it could have been so felt rather
amateurish overall, but maybe that was intentional.
