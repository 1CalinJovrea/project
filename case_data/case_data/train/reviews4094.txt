Accurate, schmaccurate

Some have cast doubts on the verisimilitude of parts of this picture.
Of course, those who impugn whether some events really happened or
whether they happened the way they are depicted in the movie neither
underwent the kind of training Navy S.E.A.Ls do nor did they ever find
themselves in circumstances remotely approaching those of the four
comrades. We do not know what punishment the human body is truly
capable of withstanding until we are put to an extreme test, gods
forbid.All I can say is that, regardless of whether this movie is accurate
100%, 0% or anything in between, it brought me to tears. I can honestly
not remember the last time a Hollywood movie did that.Very moving, very poignant, very touching. For that alone, as well as
for keeping me riveted for the whole of two hours (which is quite a
feat given my cynical and jaded nature), it deserves unalloyed
plaudits.
