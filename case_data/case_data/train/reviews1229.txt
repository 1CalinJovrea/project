I can't wait to see it again!

The last time Disney adapted a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, we
got one of my favorite films, The Little Mermaid. Now, we have a movie
that has very much the same feel as Mermaid. Frozen feels like it could
fit right in with the Disney movies of the late 80's/early 90's, like
The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. The music
is great, and I left singing it; the lead characters are very likable,
with memorable sidekicks; and there are even surprises, things you
would never expect to see in a Disney animated film! This is my
favorite movie of the year so far, and may even be my favorite movie in
years. I highly recommend this one!
