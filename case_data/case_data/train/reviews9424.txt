Just a great movie

This is not going to be a long review, there are some great reviews on
here and I think they have said all I wanted and more. The thing to
hold onto is that despite all the negative hype in the worldwide press,
this is one heck of a great movie. I have no idea why any film studio
would want to distance themselves from this film, it is fresh in a time
when fresh is a very rare thing in the movies. Avatar managed it in
heaps and so does John Carter. The story is grand and intriguing, the
characters are solid and believable, and the CGI is so good you forget
about it. This will become one of my favourite all time movies, it is
up there amongst the very best of the genre. Don't believe the hype.. this is a must see movie!!
