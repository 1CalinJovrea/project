A fascinating character study

Fassbender is magnificent in the title role, and the decision to
advance the plot through a series of keynote addresses, which is truly
what Jobs is best known for, was brilliant. The movie is a bit thin, and overly dramatic, but it isn't meant to be
a historical documentary, and overall the quick pace and liberties
taken with historical events allow it to present the story, which is
true if not in factual basis, is true in spirit. The story entertains
by virtue of packing its highlights within the neat bookends of a
bookmark address.
