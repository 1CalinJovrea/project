A new landmark for superhero and comedy films

With a brilliant script, visceral action, and a Oscar-worthy
performance by lead Ryan Reynolds, 2016's Deadpool takes superhero and
comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies
still have a lot more to offer.Proof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following
the working formula, Deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens
it with its unapologetic offensive humor, bloody and intense violence,
as well as a excellent cast and script. Deadpool is an example to not
only based ones characters and stories off of the original material,
but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.
