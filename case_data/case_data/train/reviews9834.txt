Non-Stop was one exciting plane thriller!

Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were
watching this for the first time and we both were thrilled by it. Liam
Neeson plays someone taking a flight from London. The only other player
we recognized was Julianne Moore and not much is learned about her
during most of the narrative except she takes a lot of flights and was
coming from a trying day. Oh, and she observes most of the action when
Liam talks to the crew on board when the crises happens. Plenty of
twists happen when trying to guess which passenger is responsible for
some threatening comments on Neeson's tablet so that was a plus. In
other words, it was riveting throughout! Really, all I'll say now is I
and my friend highly recommend Non-Stop!
