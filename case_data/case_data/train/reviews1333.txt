Dear god what is this rubbish

Awful, Awful, Awful, This acting is truly dreadful the story is even
worse. Bella Thorn is just embarrassing, Samara Weaving is some sort of
poor mans Margot Robbie. Do not bother with this crap. How the hell it
has a 6.6 rating is beyond me, its a 2 max. There are so many better
movies of this type around so why make this poor copy ?
