Wow, this was actually good..

I have no idea what the other people are complaining about. I was going
to watch this expecting this to be another third rate sci-movie with
teenagers acting tough, but this turned out to be a well acted movie
with an OK plot instead.Also, some monster effects were a bit cheap but I had no issue with
majority of CGI in the movie. Not sure why anyone would think it "ALL
LOOKS SO FAKE"? Get an eye checkup?Sure the clich√©d plot isn't anything Oscar-worthy, but then, so isn't
the plot for new Star Wars movies being pumped out and over-hyped by
paid reviewers and fanboys.Watch this, ignore the negative reviews. Considering I watched it for
lulz thinking, it was a another cheap terrible sci-fi movie, I enjoyed
it.I would've rated 6/10 but rating it 8/10 cause this movie is being
downvoted by sci-fi snobs.
