Worst movie EVER

I have to admit, I've never seen any of the Twilight movies previous to
this one. Accompanied my girlfriend on this one since she went with me
to see Skyfall...Caveat--I'm a guy and this is definitely not my type of movie. But I
say with no equivocation that I tried to be open minded...I REALLY DID.
I mean...she dragged me to the indie film "The Paperboy" and I actually
enjoyed that.OK. This was the worst piece of tripe I have EVER SEEN. I couldn't find
one redeeming thing about this abomination of a "movie". Did it really
have a budget of $75,000,000???? The movie effects looked so fake (The
CGI effects used to make the baby were HORRIBLE. The scenes where the
characters are moving at some sort of hyper-vampire speed were a joke).
The lines were so cheesy and hackneyed (and horribly delivered by the
actors) that it was laughable. The story line was completely
disjointed...there was no flow to it at all.I saw someone's earlier review here where she stated that she asked her
friend "Is this a real movie?" Exactly. I found myself in disbelief the
entire time.My girlfriend...who admitted that this franchise was a guilty pleasure
of hers---said she loved the other movies---FELL ASLEEP halfway
through. This is someone who loves this franchise. In her words--this
movie was a complete waste, there was no reason to break the final
movie into two parts. They could have summed up everything that
happened in this one by adding 15 minutes onto the last one and it
would have made a much cleaner ending.Biggest waste of two hours in my entire life. Waiting in line for two
hours at the DMV to have one of their employees perform a root canal on
me, while listening to Britney Spears perform "Oops I Did It Again"
live would have been less torturous.
