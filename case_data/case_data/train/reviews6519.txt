sappy, predictable garbage

Well. Hollywood just keeps putting out the same mindless drivel. There
are too many overworked themes to list, not to mention a predictable
plot..As soon as he started looking for her, you knew that he would not tell
her WHY he looked her up. He would start and get interrupted. She'd
find out about the picture and that would be the basis of the "conflict
between him/her" part of the movie. Then it would get worked out. Totally unbelievable action on the part of the sheriff is to be
expected in today's Hollywood garbage movies. And, that is not the only
horrendous acting in the movie.Please forget about wasting $ on a DVD, don't even waste your time
watching it on TV.
