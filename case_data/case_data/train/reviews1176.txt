How can you stay alive after watching this?

Two vampire lovers reunite after a long time to carry on their love
story. Adam is now a musician and Eve has reach to be a strong woman.
The romance is disturbed by Ava and one evening when she was bored
comes with the idea to go out all together including Ian a young boy
who frequently helps Adam with supplies. After they get back home Ava
can't help herself and kills Ian and the couple must now take care of
the body and cover any tracks. The visit from Ava will destroy the
relation or they are to experienced to know that the actions of a
selfish girl can't change their feelings for each other?7.6 ??? Seriously? For what? The first 45 minutes of the movie are
painful to watch because there is nothing happening, then after one
hour or so the story begins to reveal. Also it's too long, boring and
slow. Nothing really happens for the whole film. It had every bad
things in it to convince me not to like it or not to vote the movie
with a greater grade.
