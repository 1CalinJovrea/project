Tasteless and just not funny.

I get really tired of movies like this one that provide a distorted
view for young girls. The main characters are all beautiful and
snorting cocaine and cheating on boyfriends. Real people that use
cocaine, don't look like that for long and they end up with heart
failure and many other health issues.Aside from all that the movie just wasn't funny. I watched it because
the fat girl was in it and I'd seen her in other things where she was
pretty darn funny, but she's hardly in this movie. Instead the movie
centers around the somehow beautiful cocaine addicts that can't land a
joke if they even tried. Kirsten Dunst's character was probably the
worst because it seems the writers thought it would be funny to have
someone screaming and cussing a lot when it's just aggravating and
makes you want to see a boxing match afterwards.
