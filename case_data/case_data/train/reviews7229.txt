Not Twilight At All

Okay so here is the deal with this movie. no it doesn't follow the book
exactly, but then again, what movie really does? I read all the books
in this series about 3 years ago and just finished the last in the
series recently. The movie got the main events pretty much right so
that is all that matters. The effects were pretty amazing and I have
nothing to complain about on the acting. But the only thing that
bothers me is that people keep calling this Twilight. For one, Twilight has poor acting and a stupid story line. I read the
books before the movies, and they were only okay. This has a fantastic
story line and it is more... realistic i guess. Yes it has magic and
what not but he likes her because of her! Not because he "just cant
stay away from her". The movie does have a lot of romance but it's more
believable that they really care for each other. It is an insult comparing this amazing book and pretty good movie to
Twilight. Yes if you like Twilight you should like this too, just
because Twilight was made into a movie first does not mean that this
should be compared to it. It is not a Twilight copy. Especially if you
read the book, it is for a much more mature mind.
