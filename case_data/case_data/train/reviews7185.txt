Its a different world...

Following on from the events of the Avengers movie, Thor is back in
Asgard, delivering Loki, who is damned to spend an eternity in the
Asgardian dungeons.Jane is in London, still pining for the titular character, as she
hasn't seen him for two years, but still holding out for him.But there is a new threat from the dark elves. They seek an elixir type
essence that will cause darkness amongst the nine realms.Jane however has found a portal into one of the realms, and gets
infected by the essence. Because the dark elves can trace this source,
Thor rescues her and takes her back to Asgard, much to Odins dismay.But the elves plan an attack on Asgard, and after many lives are lost,
Thor realises that only one person can help him, and he's damned for
the rest of his life....The first movie was wonderful. Not only was it exciting and refreshing,
but it was one of the funniest Marvel movies released yet. This however
takes a huge step back, and really taints phase two of the Marvel
releases.Hemsworth is as good as ever, as is Hiddleston, but apart from Portman,
it appears that the rest of the cast have been sidelined, so Thor and
Loki can carry on their war of nerves.It's also very convoluted, narrative is lost as there is so much going
on, and by the end of it all, you wondered what on earth went on, an
also what happened to a few of the characters, there are plot holes
aplenty.The humour what was wonderful in the first movie, feels really forced
in this, and instead of causing unexpected laughter, had me rolling my
eyes as to how silly it felt. Dennings is a thorn in the movies side,
she is a parody of her character from the first, and ruins every scene
she is in.The best joke in the film, which was in the trailer, steals from
Raiders of the Lost Ark anyway.Visuals are bland and boring, and Asgard feels like something from The
Phantom Menace, combined with Flash Gordon, and the rest of the realms
could have come from any Lord Of The Rings movie.Its a shame, because Marvel know they have a winning formula, but here
it feels like they are just in it for the money, and all the cool
references and a brilliant cameo, cannot save such a disappointment.Many will call it Thor-some and other play on word praises.But for me, and I really hate saying this because Hemsworth is really
good, it's pretty Thor-ful.
