I see white people!

Brian (Tyler Perry) grounds Tiffany (Diamond White) on Halloween. She
wants to go to the UTF party and she is only 17. Madea and her friends
come over to baby sit while Brian can go do some work. People play
pranks on each other and the girls sneak out.I stopped watching Tyler Perry films a while back because it has the
same stale humor, and the same running jokes. The banter has become old
and this film tried too hard to be amusing and never achieves it.The movie is not for kids: B-word, N-word, tap that A-word, P-word your
pants, "playing with myself", ho, and in one scene Madea opens her
blouse to show the Frat boys her boobs and invites them to touch them.
I thought them making fun of the overweight kid was cheap humor. The
Frat boys were poorly written. Tyler Perry needs to come up with
something new.
