Stylistic and unique superhero movie

I actually really like this movie. I applaud them for daring to try
something different. There really aren't any other movies quite like
this. It definitely draws closely from various movies, but its not like
your average superhero movie.I think the plot is actually really cool and is actually pretty
realistic for a superhero movie. The cinematography is beautiful and
the locations and production design are nice as well. The whole
Japanese samurai ninja culture is always cool and it is fun to see it
blended with an x- men story. There aren't many other superheroes in this movie, which is refreshing.
Especially nowadays where they seem to pack way too many characters
into every movie. Besides Wolverine, I really only recall poison Ivy
being in the movie, and she goes by a different name and looks mostly
like a normal person.I forget what the criticism was of this movie. I remember people
complaining that Wolverine doesn't have his powers for most of the
movie, but that didn't bother me at all. The story builds to a nice
climax and the pace is pretty good.I wish more superhero movies would take risks and try to be original
and creative like they did here. Go see this movie if you like a good
action flick or x-men or Samurai culture.
