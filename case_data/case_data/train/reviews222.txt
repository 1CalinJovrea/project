Why This Movie Is Vile

Really? You people who give this a good review weren't creeped out
about two guys who barely know this woman breaking into her house,
planting bugs, spying on her every move (in every room?) Or getting the
CIA (to which they very unconvincingly belong) to use vast resources to
illegally track her? Who do you root for in this movie? Me, I was
rooting for the bad guys to slowly dispose of them in a vat of acid
after poking them full of holes, so the acid would hurt more. Aside
from that, the characters act like love-struck teen-agers (sorry
teen-agers), the action scenes are totally unbelievable (walking up,
unguarded, to a trio of assassins guns a-blazing at you, with only a
handgun), and oh, don't get me started. Pay attention to what the
characters are actually doing, instead of just liking them because
you're 'supposed' to, and you'll totally be turned off. If you're
female, think of how you'd react to a guy you dated once or twice
breaking into your home and spying on you. End of story.
