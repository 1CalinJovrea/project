This is a sumptuous, beautifully produced period horror drama. It
reminds me of the kind of carefully crafted historical chillers the BBC
sometimes produces for the autumn audience, the like of which receives
acceptable ratings against the talent show dross elsewhere on
mainstream television, and receives complaints from the cavilling
general public for being 'too dark'.I love it: the smoky charnel houses, the rain and waste-strewn cobbles,
the dim light, class divides, penny dreadfuls, pox-ridden low-lives,
music hall drabs, salty gags, cockney peelers, pea-soupers and the
streets of London 'running red with blood.' Dan Leno (Douglas Booth), a
kind of Victorian Russell Brand, takes an avuncular interest in young
Elizabeth Cree (Olivia Cooke), who is under suspicion for murdering her
husband. Inspector John Kildare (Bill Nighy in a role originally taken
by the late Alan Rickman) has evidence that her husband may be the
legendary murderer 'the Limehouse Golem', and is determined to save
Elizabeth from a date with the gallows.There are those who say Bill Nighy only ever plays himself. I think
there is truth to this, but when you have cornered the market so
brilliantly, why step outside of it? Here, he is exceptional as always
as the Inspector, with much support from the excellent Daniel Mays as
Constable George Flood. In a small role Damien Thomas (Count Karnstein
in Hammer's 1971 'Twins of Evil') plays heavily bearded Soloman Veil.
Maria Valverde is wonderful as the arch Aveline Ortega.A terrific twisted, twisty tale admirably directed by Juan Carlos
Medina. Well worth your time.
