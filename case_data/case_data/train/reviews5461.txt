Just awful, does not deserve any of the praise.

Mindbogglingly bad film. I can't believe there are so many people
saying lyrical things about it. Is this really what substitutes a good
film in the year 2017? Come on.The story is just so stupid and totally full of holes, right from the
get go. Scene 1: Logan is sleeping it off in his fancy limo when he is
woken by some Latino guys that are trying to steal his rims. The car is
jacked up and we clearly see them loosening the nuts of one of the
tires. Logan slashes them up, removes the jack and then drives off real
fast. Eh... what about that loose tire? And so on, stupidity after
stupidity, through the whole film!There are people praising the characters. The characters, really? A
bunch of morons completely and frustratingly unable to communicate with
each other, unable to make any logical or reasonable decisions, and so
utterly predictable. Charles constantly (more or less subtly) telling
Logan that he is a stupid and unloved oaf, is that like peoples idea of
cinematic tension between characters, showing profound depths of
humanity? Seriously, tripe.And the action... I mean honestly, after like the 10th goon has had his
eyes poked out by Logan or mini-girly-Spanish-I-can-suddenly-speak-
English-where-the-h**l-did-I-learn-that-Logan it's not really that
fascinating. Oh look, the spikes can come out through this side of the
skull too, whey! Yes, a lot of people do get killed, slashed, maimed,
decapitated, etc. in this film, but that does not make it great. Not by
a long shot.There is seriously nothing great about this film. So just avoid it. Or
watch it and waste a couple of hours of your life like I did of mine.
