Don't get your hopes up

I'm a big fan of Frank Miller's work, and "Sin City" (2005) and "300"
(2006) are two of my favorite films. But just as the sequel "300 Rise
of an Empire" disappointed, this sequel is not up to the original. In
fact, it is so far from the original it's disturbing. There is nothing
new here, and much of what made the original entertaining is missing as
well. More problematic, everyone's voice seems the same.Some of the guest stars (Christopher Lloyd, Jeremy Priven, Chris
Melonik, Jude Ciccolella) are on screen for such a short period of time
it's a waste. Meanwhile, the bulk of the story revolves around John
Brolin who doesn't have the charisma to carry the film, and Bruce
Willis as a ghost is a waste of everyone's time. Jessica Alba has
little to do except dance, which she does very well.If like me you're a fan of Miller's work you'll want to go see this,
but don't get your hopes up too high.
