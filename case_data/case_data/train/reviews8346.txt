Very enjoyable exploration of emotional bond between a human and animal

I really enjoyed this film. It explores the emotional bond between an
animal and a human being.The film is based on the true story of marine corporal who forms a
unique bond with a bomb-sniffing dog. Megan Leavey (Kate Mara) enlists
to get away from what seems to be a hopeless civilian life. She is an
aimless young woman with a deadbeat mom, Jackie (Edie Falco). Megan
struggles to fit in as a Marine and, after a disciplinary hearing due
to misappropriate behavior, is caught urinating outside of the Provost
office after a night of drinking. She is assigned to clean up the K- 9
unit under the command of Gunny Martin (Common). Gunny Martin is a
commander who uses tough love while being a mentor. My favorite scene in the movie is when Megan finds out that she will
get a dog to train and it turns out to be a can. It seems that newbies
practice training a dog with a can. It is a bit humorous but shows
Megan's determination to get a real dog. Megan bonds with an aggressive
German shepherd name Rex and is given the opportunity to train him.
Megan and Rex end up completing more than 100 missions, but an IED
explosion injures them both and puts their fate in jeopardy.Megan Leavey has lots of wartime violence, strong language and intense
themes including trauma and grief. It also shows the strength of women
and their accomplishments while not focusing on the brutality of war.
This is an inspiring film that I believe is most suited for ages 13 to
18 as well as some adults. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. It opens
nationwide June 9, 2017 so, be sure to go see it and learn what happens
to Megan and Rex. Reviewed by Juanita Seon L. KIDS FIRST! Adult Juror.
