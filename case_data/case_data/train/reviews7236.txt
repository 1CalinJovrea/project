Just watch it

You know what. With a busy lifestyle and so much to do everyday, every
now and then you just need to watch an action movie that you do not
need to think too much about, that simply washes over you and puts a
nostalgic smile on your face.The plot might be thin, you know it will likely come good in the end
and you know that the good guy is going to win. But that does not
matter a jot. It is filled with quips, familiar faces, memories of the
80's and just good fun.There will be people that hate this film as just another example of
mindless violence, but who cares. It is what it is.If that is what you need, then go and see this film. I loved it.
