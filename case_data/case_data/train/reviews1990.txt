Few zombies, much Jane Austen!

Surprisingly better than I expected, with few zombies, not too much
blood and much Jane Austen. A fun (and quite accurate) adaptation of
one of the iconic novels in English literature, with the variant of the
threat of zombies, well-argued, and martial arts fights in which women
are the protagonists. With good actors, actresses overwhelmingly
beautiful, good settings, nice cinematography (beautiful atmosphere and
lighting) and extraordinary locations it seems that some of them are
the same than the 2005's «serious version» with Keira K. and an open
end that promises more blood, more battles and more zombies (though I
doubt that the history can be stretched more). Very recommendable, at
least as a curiosity very well done.
