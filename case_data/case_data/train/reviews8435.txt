Terrible movie.  Amazing what people believe nowadays

This movie is unrealistic trash. Two girls go out cage diving with
whites. The cage and boat they are in are in no condition to be out on
the water. Cage diving with sharks is a highly regulated activity. It's
not run by a bunch of dirt poor mexicans with trash gear. White sharks
aren't as aggressive as they make them look in this Hollywood crap
movie. Terrible acting and screenplay. The director must have an IQ of around
70 to find this sort of film work acceptable.All this movie is doing is making stupid people afraid of the water,
and hate sharks.
