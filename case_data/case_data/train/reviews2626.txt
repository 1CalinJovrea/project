An intellectually stimulating movie for sexually frustrated teenagers.

This film is not porn. It is not shocking or provocative and definitely
not 'deep'. We get to watch the sexual binging of a person and the effect it has on
their life. All would be OK if that was the point of the film. Viewers
who have seen genitals before may go in for an exploration of the
psychology of a sex addict or even (and preferably if you ask me) an
exploration of the philosophical stand point of such a person but all
they'll get is the trendy, immature and ill informed opinions of a
rebellious teenager who just came across the word 'feminism' in the
dictionary.The only way to save this script is to decide that it's a story about a
person who never accepted the consequences of their actions.Not that Von Trier does anything to help us decide that mind you...P.s. The film is well made so if you enjoy moving images, go for it.
