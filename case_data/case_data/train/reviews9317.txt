9
An enjoyable movie for the whole family

I had read this book last year, and we visited the Springs just after
they finished filming, so I was eagerly awaiting the film's release. I
am a Redford fan and enjoyed his previous movies with Fonda very much
(I think there have been 3 previously?). This movie was heartfelt and
entertaining. Fonda is always entertaining-I enjoy her in anything she
does and she does not disappoint in this role. Redford was also good,
played kind of a dry wit-he also never disappoints. The little boy did
a good job also. If I have anything at all negative to say, it would be
that it seems to move a little slowly-hence my 9 rating. That may just
be me since I had read the book, or maybe my sense of being entertained
has been warped by binge watching Shameless, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad.
But this G-rated movie was definitely a heart-warming story for
everyone in every family.
