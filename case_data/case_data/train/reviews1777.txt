Great Movie that will bring about tears.

I absolutely loved this movie. It was very touching and sometimes
extremely hard to watch at times. I strongly recommend watching this
movie.Pros: Acting was magnificent - especially Will Smith. He really
captivates the audience with this one. The story line was well thought
out and east to folly. Anyone could easily to relate to the
situations/characters. It also had a wonderful surprise ending.Cons: A little on the long side I would have liked for them to have
gone deeper into the 3 abstract concepts.You will enjoy this movie. I suggest you bring a tissue too. :-)
