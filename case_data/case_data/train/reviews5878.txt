This is how thrillers should feel like

Went in to see this movie with high expectations and this didn't let me
down. It is a proper thriller with a great story, great acting and
great direction.The story is superb. Its original and exciting. A viewer will for sure
feel all the awkwardness,fear,uncertainty,contempt and the jump scares
to their bones. The director did everything perfectly. He showed just
enough, nothing more nothing less. I liked this style a lot.On the acting side Bateman and Edgerton were extraordinary. Rebeca Hall
was pretty great but these two were the main reason this was so
exciting and frightening to watch. I didn't think Bateman could do
serious stuff this seriously to be honest.It was a thriller and it thrilled me every moment I was watching it.
Loved it and I think it completely deserves all the praises its getting
from everyone.
