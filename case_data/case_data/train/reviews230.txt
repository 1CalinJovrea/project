Sad but true

Italian neorealism is alive, different than De Sica's or Visconti's
neorealism, what we have here is a new, direct and probably more
"hollywood oriented" kind of neorealism.Living myself in Rome I see these characters every day: The corrupted
politician, the violent gypsy family, the rich, fashion and selfish
pimp, the right wing former terrorist now working with the mafia from
the south, what we would here call "coatto" (Number 8) the uneducated
and violent kid who run his territory and who's been involved in the
"waterfront" project just because it is "his" territory....the Vatican
and all it's power....all you can see in this movie, all those
characters are real, not that you meet them walking on the streets of
Rome, but you know they're there and it's sad to say but there's
nothing you can do to stop them, you can only watch this movie and
think for a moment it is just a movie, it is not real.
