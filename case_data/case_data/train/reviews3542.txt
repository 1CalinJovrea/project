Great movie, ending ruins it all.

It's really a shame to see a movie with this potential being ruined by
ACT III. It just doesn't add up, the development of the character feels
sometimes unreasonable. Nikolaj does an excellent job, but the way the
movie goes just doesn't make sense to me, being quite easy being
disappointed with ACT III.
