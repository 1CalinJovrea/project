Una...mierda!

I couldn't see it thoroughly. Had to fast forward some endless scenes
with nothing to add. Hole plot. Ridicullous flash backs over and over
and over again. I couldn't believe. The pace was all wrong. The
music...tedious! The dialogues all the same. Same questions. Same
answers. It just never ended. Awful movie. While the theme is thick and
dense, the exploitation of it is barely done. The movie made me fall
asleep several times. Avoid this one.
