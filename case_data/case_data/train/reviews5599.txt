Boring Mass Confusion

In an effort to link as many of the old cast with a new crew by
creating back and forth mini scenes just adds to the overall feeling of
confusion. Add friendly aliens, a drunk boat crew monitoring the status
of aliens drilling into the Ocean floor, poor graphics of cities being
toasted, and crowded (who's who?) air combat scenes all add to my
impression of a overall bad movie.The first Independence Day movie was great. This sequel proves that a
bad action movie can put you to sleep. The ending with the Queen alien
seeking revenge was a stolen concept from Aliens (1986).I love good science fiction. This is not.
