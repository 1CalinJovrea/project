the only part that is more stupid than this movie is the people laughing at it

It wasn't funny. It was not smart. It was full of clichés and stolen
old over used plot devices. predictable. It spent most of its time
acting over the top stupid thinking the audience will laugh at extreme
stupidity. other movies have done this much better. even with the old
and tired plot devices and clichés, because they were funny, i enjoyed
the humor. i didn't enjoy this movie and wanted to leave.
