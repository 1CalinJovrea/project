gorgeous picture

I tremendously enjoyed this movie. Some people think this is a story
about a girl who loses her legs. It's not. The story isn't about her.
The real main character in this story perhaps is Ali, played by
Matthias Schoenaerts. Well maybe it's not about him as well. What this
story is definitely about is fighting. This story is not meant to be
touching, it is all about coping strategies. With Ali it's really fight
or flee, for Marie it's getting back on your feet after a devastating
blow. Matthias does an excellent job, acting a lower class man with no real
education. He is simple minded and he is quite rude, but he has a
gentle side to him. I like the ink that Marie gets done, marking the stubs of her legs
'droit' and 'gauche', left and right. To me that is a subtle way of
showing that she is beginning to accept her situation. I found the casting for this movie refreshing. The looks of the
characters aren't perfect. I find that I am getting tired of what seems
that all actors and actresses are looking less distinctive than ever.
