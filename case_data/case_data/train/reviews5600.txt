Yuck!  Sex with children?  Liberals will give this one awards

Critics are drooling this fall over the Sundance hit, a drama about a
17-year-old male student living with his parents in Italy who's wooed
into a homosexual relationship by a 24-year-old grad student played by
Armie Hammer. None of the reviews from the major publications seemed to
even notice this age discrepancy.At least one homosexual author, Chad Felix Greene, has come out against
the movie's promotion of sexual relationships between men and boys. He
wrote, For me it is simply an issue of responsible adult
decision-making. When an adult has sex with a teenager, they are being
selfish, fulfilling their own temporary desires. They do not recognize
or possibly even care about the impact that encounter can have on a
very young and impressionable mind trapped between finding security in
who they are and assuming more wisdom than they currently have. Greene
came under fire from the left for his comments. Many people argued that
the legal age of consent in Italy is 14 (as if that had anything to do
with objective moral values and ethics).The sheer number of people arguing in favor of an age of consent at 14
Â… should be enough of a wake-up call."
