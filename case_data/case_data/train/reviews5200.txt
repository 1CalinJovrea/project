Hangover Part 3 - Without a hangover

I am so disappointed. i absolutely loved the hangover parts 1 & 2, and
was so excited about the 3rd installment, even going to see the
midnight screening, but was so let down. I still don't even understand
what the writers were trying to do? were all the comedy writers in
Hollywood all sick at the exact same time this script was being
written? Worst of all, No One was Hungover! How can you name a movie
the hangover, when it involves no drinking, stupidity or a hangover?
the only part i can honestly say i loved was the short after wedding
skit after the credits. THAT is the movie i wanted to watch, along with
everyone else in the cinema from what everyone started screaming at the
screen. Please make that into an 1 1/2 hour long film to regain the
honor of a hangover movie, coz what i watched, was dismal at best.
