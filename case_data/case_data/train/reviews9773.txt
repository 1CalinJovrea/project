Why Rajkumar Hirani ???

I did not feel offended by any of the things related to god.Everyone
has a perspective of looking at a religion there is nothing right or
wrong in that.My main concern was the movie as a whole.It felt as if
this movie was made to give a Tribute to Aamir Khan.For example Boman
Irani is such a great actor but he was only like a prop in the film.
There was nothing in the movie which touched by heart as a whole unlike
other films of Rajkumar Hirani which kept me thinking about it even
after going out of the movie theater.There were some scenes which were
irritating and not even funny and were just put to show the whole world
of why Aamir khan is such a great actor.The songs were like children's
poem.I just want to tell everyone that don't blindly appreciate
whatever he does,he is not always right and perfect.If this movie was
made with a new comer it surely would have bombed at the box office.The
movie didn't have a particular story to keep you edged at the
seats,things just kept happening with a few laughs here and there.There
are so much better movies made which don't get that appreciation
because of the small star cast and low marketing.
