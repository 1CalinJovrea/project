I expected more.....

I am a huge fan of the exorcism movie genre and this movie just simply
did not meet my expectations.Now, before I go on to say that this movie was all around bad I will
first start off my saying it was not. The opening sequence was a great
way to set the tone of what is to be a good film. The possessed child,
Emily delivered her character very well and will always remain
memorable, sort of like that of Isabelle Fuhrman (Orphan). whilst
watching this film I couldn't help but be scared, the film delivers at
being suspenseful and scary but not horrific. Special effects makeup,
short demonic dialogue, the death of only 1 character and extreme harm
to 2 characters does not in my opinion define horror. Lacking
originality during the ending of the film I was reminded of "The Devil
Inside" with the exorcism performed in the desolate hospital and the
demon flipping out causing harm to her loved ones and the person
performing the exorcism along with the demonic transitioning from the
Daughter to the Father. In comparison "The Devil Inside", was from
Mother to Daughter.Originality in this film came from the Jewish exorcist. Not done
before, every one of this films predecessors turn to Christian exorcist
to perform exorcisms, so that was a plus. As well as the families
struggles which remains relate-able to all viewers in some shape, way
or form.I won't spend to much time with this any longer but I did like the film
as an overall production just expected a little more based on the
teasers and trailers especially since the first Exorcist movie (Linda
Blair) still remains a perfect 10 therefore, the best in its genre. I
only wish that production companies would stop being so hasty to
release films that just does not live up to its expected genre.
