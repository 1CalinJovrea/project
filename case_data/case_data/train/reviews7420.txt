So Sad, Great Book...Movie...Not So Much

I loved this book! The details in the book about Abraham's younger
years, the historical facts and dates - loved it all. The characters
around Abraham were very real and important to the story (in my
opinion). Spoilers follow:The movie was NOTHING like the book. The characters were different
except for their names and some didn't show up at all. The events that
made it from the book to the move were out of order in the movie. The
details mentioned above - non- existent in the movie. The story was so
choppy, leaving out huge portions of events. I am aware that not
everything can be translated to a movie in a timely manner; however, it
can be done far better than it was done in this movie.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this movie. Don't waste your
time/money. Read the book - it is so much better.
