A love story ~

Cast chosen are all well suited to the characters; they performed as if
the story was theirs to share ~ A love story that will test the
assumptions of viewers. Enjoyable, well acted, well done. A plausible plot supported by
characters and settings that make plausible more than probable. Our preview audience appeared surprised at the chance to see a great
cast in a simple story of love. Laughter because Harrison Ford holds a
mirror to the lives of the audience, and we see ourselves. Blake Lively
never gives us a hint of deviation from her assumed promise. Lots of historical fact that interests rather than bores the mind, and
never obscures the journey we're following with the characters. Michiel
Huisman plays innocence with persistence, grace, and a smile; we laugh
and cheer him on. Ellen Burstyn plays a subtle catalyst role. Kathy
Baker always seems to pull the characters together, and none of the
cast can take away our interest from the science and character of
Adaline. I'll see it again, in the theater for the larger than life
characters. Thanks crew, staff, and actors.
