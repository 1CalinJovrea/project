Great story, well told

6 November 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon -
Burnt. Bradley Cooper stars as chef Adam Jones, who having lost
everything is clawing his way back to the top in quest to gain that
elusive third Michelin Star. On the way he is facing his demons head on
and affecting all those who work with him. Beautifully shot with camera
angles that make you feel you are right in the thick of the action,
this is not so much a film about food but more in the way it's prepared
and presented. Having said that if cooking is not your thing don't be
put off, not least because of the chance of looking at Bradley Cooper
for a couple of hours, but there is a story to be told here and an
interesting one. I did get a sense that creating a menu could be the
most exciting thing in the world but I wouldn't want to work in his
kitchen. I really enjoyed this film, made a refreshing change.
