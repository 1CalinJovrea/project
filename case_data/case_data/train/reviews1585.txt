Excellent (keep in mind, I read the book)

Along with his thousands of other fans, I can consider myself a big
Nicholas Sparks fan. I normally enjoy reading his books and watching
his movies, but The Longest Ride is one I particularly enjoyed as novel
and film.Go ahead, call me biased, but I really liked this story. It was
different from his other stories and there wasn't some tragedy that led
to the unnecessary fatality of a main character. In other words, it has
a good ending. That's definitely going against his normal plots.The acting was better than I expected. I'm not really the biggest fan
of Britt Robertson (Sophia) but she did a great job acting. I did
expect, however, that Scott's acting would be outstanding. Not only is
he attractive beyond belief and his body is to-die-for, but he's also
down-to-earth and the perfect Luke.This film adaption follows the incredible novels sequence of events
pretty well. That's what I liked most about it.It's not better than The Notebook (nothing can ever beat that one) but
it is better than Safe Haven or The Last Song. I suggest you see this
movie as quickly as you can!
