Time does not heal all wounds.

Time does not heal all wounds. One thing leads to another in six
outrageous, hilarious and extreme stories of revenge. A jilted and
emotionally volatile bride wreaks havoc at her wedding with an equally
unstable new husband, a towing company hauls away one too many times
the vehicle belonging an explosive expert, and two macho drivers  one
in an Audi and the other in a pile of junk  go head to head with
explosive road rage, among other delicious and fiery adventures. The
utmost fantasies fulfilled, the extremes of emotions, and the riot of
laughter that engulfed me from all sides, I cannot remember having such
a good time watching a film. The director, who answered questions at
the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, said the film is about
the pleasure of losing control and giving in to unrestrained passions.
Is it ever!
