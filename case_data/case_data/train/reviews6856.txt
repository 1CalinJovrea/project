I got dizzy watching this movie

One of the worst movie editing I've ever seen in my life for an action
movie. That killed the movie for me. I think they should just withdraw
Taken 2 and Taken 3 and admit that they should have stopped at the
first one.This movie was so boring, and when you expected to see some action
scenes, you were getting yourself in the paranoid mind of a director
who wanted to experiment on the poor audience. My eyes still hurt from
the crappy editing of this movie.Guys please stop here, enough, no more Taken sequels. With each one of
them you're killing the hype that the first one created.
