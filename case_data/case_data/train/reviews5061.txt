Well Made But Depressing and Oddly Cold

Well acted, gorgeously photographed and competently directed, this
depressing true tale is oddly cold and sterile. Garfield and Foy are
excellent but the end result is sadly forgettable. The great Diana Rigg
shows up in a why bother 3 minutes or less cameo. Good intentions on
the filmmakers part and a fascinating true story make for a film
lacking emotional impact.
