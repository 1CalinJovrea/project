Different, but enjoyable

Alex Murphy, damaged in an explosion to the point of death, is the
ideal candidate for a new initiative to join human sensibilities to
computerised and robotic peace-keeping hardware. But Murphy has his own
mind, which leads to conflict with those responsible for the attempt on
his life (plus others), which may stretch beyond the criminal
fraternity.The 2014 remake of Paul Verhoeven's classic 1987 sci-fi satire includes
most of the story beats from the original, but has quite a different
heart. This makes it into a different film, and one which I enjoyed as
much as the original.Despite being full of action, it is a much gentler film. The violence
is not as sadistic, there is no profanity (imagine that!), the
relationship between Alex and his family is much more important, and
Gary Oldman's conflicted Dr Frankenstein - sorry, Dr Norton - is a fine
character: he is the actual heart of the movie.If you loved the 1987 version with a passion then you may hate this. If
you merely liked it, you may like this version too.
