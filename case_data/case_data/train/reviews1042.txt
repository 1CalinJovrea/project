Why, I mean Why??

1st of all Mr. Captian America justifies his acting and screen presence
only with action movie kind of characters....That kind of roles suit his (expressionless) personality and acting
skills (to an extent), But now you have him play this character, that
too in a worn out screenplay;and, with shitty dialogues, that you know
he can never carry or make us believe in it.This movie fools us to watch it, just due to it's exemplary star cast. But, It's just a trap for us to watch this sorry movie. Why do this?I
mean why waste all this effort? Reprimand the CSA, for cheating his/her
profession.
