Avoidable Garbage

The biggest let down. I love the Bourne series including legacy which
was without Matt Damon. This movie is poorly thought out and has a weak
script which we all have seen and heard before. Camera work is what
really put me off - show me perspective, not in your face cameras with
flashing lights. The camera work is so poor at times that even the car
chase on the Vegas strip with tanks and RVs is less exciting and a
poorer construct than the slow little red car chase in Paris in Bourne
Identity. Tommy Lee Jones looks like 95 years old and the woman trying
to get his job looks like 25 !! How believable is that ? The only thing
good was the movie moves quite quickly from city to city - sometimes
without reason. Save your money and watch something else.
