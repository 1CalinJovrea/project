Fifty Shades Darker Â– Anastasia Bites her Lip Again

Stars Minnesota Johnson as the submissive girlfriend and Jamie
Doorknob, as the dominant, controlling boyfriend. This is soft-core
porn for girls and I noticed that the screening I attended was almost
entirely a female audience. Though be aware that the erotic scenes are
not the kind of sex girls want to see or probably enjoy. I didn't care about the lead actors, who had very little chemistry in
between the sex scenes and even those were pretty dull, the elevator
scene is a good example of what I mean. The plot is poor, the drama is rubbish, the acting is wooden, and the
dialogue is laughable rubbish. The film is unintentionally funny when
supposed to be serious, and boring when supposed to be sexy. Although
sexier than the original film (my wife tells me) not as graphically
sexy as the book. I sat through the pain of this and at the end felt
glad I wasn't Christian Grey, though being a billionaire is always very
appealing. So in summary, this is a rubbish sequel to the original garbage but
will do very well because it's been released over the limited window
coinciding with the Valentine's period.
