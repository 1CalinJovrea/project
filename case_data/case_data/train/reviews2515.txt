Top Notch Bubble Gum Horror

Had to take a few minutes to sign up for an account so I could leave a
review of this movie. I almost didn't bother watching it after reading
a lot of negative reviews. Fortunately I ignored them when I realized
they were mostly insulting all the things great bubble gum horror
movies thrive on. Predictability, stereotyped high school characters,
dumb decisions, trying too hard soundtracks and on and on.Throw in some A list actors and the mention of minimal gore and it
sounded like exactly the sort of Saturday night movie I was looking
for. And it didn't disappoint at all. Joey King is really good. You can
completely believe in the decisions her character makes. Phillipe is
less douche bag then I've ever seen him and Sherilyn Fenn is still
kicking which is fun to see.The writing is really bang on for this type of movie other than the
girl who says "hot sauce" and other stupid things that sound more like
someone trying to parody bad dialogue. Same thing goes for the
characters. I found most of their actions understandable. In reality
people can and do make bad decisions. There's nothing here that makes
you throw up your arms and say "Ah Come on! Nobody would do that!"
That's a real deal breaker in a lot of horror movies.In short, the perfect horror for fans of fun horror in the Final
Destination vein.
