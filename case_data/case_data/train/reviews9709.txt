Metafiction

Paul Dano plays Calvin, a dead sad and dead serious young writer, who
has apparently used the royalties from his one hugely popular novel to
finance an ultramodern iPod-themed house, and yet still chooses to use
a typewriter. In the depths of his writer's block he fashions a few
choice sentences about a woman - Ruby Sparks - who is his dream girl.
His literature makes her literal, and Calvin is able to control her
moods and actions by typing. It's reminiscent of Stranger Than Fiction
with Will Ferrell, although Dano plays his part more like Jim Carrey
might have done a decade ago: broad and physical, but with subtlety and
pathos behind the mugging.In a welcome tonal shift, Ruby Sparks moves gradually from hip romantic
comedy to meta-horror - although it feels like there's a bit too much
of the former, as I got the feeling that the zany pixie girl and self-
hating writer stereotypes were being indulged more than they were being
deconstructed. So what could have been a really interesting Woody
Allen-esque philosophical rabbit-hole ends up cutting a far more
familiar, shallower groove. But still, it's satisfying to see a
cautionary flourish to go with the wish fulfilment.Ruby herself is played by ZoÃ« Kazan, granddaughter of the great Elia
(On the Waterfront et al), with great energy and some charm. Kazan also
wrote the film. So we have a film about art imitating life, written by
the actor playing the title character, starring her real-life partner
(Dano), and directed by the real-life partnership of Jonathan Dayton
and Valerie Faris (best known for Little Miss Sunshine). So it's a
helluva conundrum; but it's also well-made, sometimes funny and
thought- provoking, and includes amusing cameos from Elliot Gould,
Annette Bening, Steve Coogan and Antonio Banderas - so definitely worth
a watch.
