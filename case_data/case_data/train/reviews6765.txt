A dark love story with a splash of gore.

Crimson is "of a rich deep red color inclining to purple". It's a color
of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure -
all of which are contained in Del Toro's latest film, Crimson Peak.Guillermo del Toro is no stranger to adding detailed elements in a film
to add depth, subtle or not. In Crimson Peak, his use of color and
setting accompany the characters in a dark Gothic tale of love and
deceit, with a sprinkle of suspense and gore that take the viewer on an
enchanting experience. Rich color tones stylize the film for a gritty and unique ambiance.
Edith, the main heroine, lives in a world where everything is dull and
dark. But her presence, however, is evident in subdued yellows, greens,
and neutral colors as she stands out in the world she resides in. Her
pale skin and light hair also attribute to the innocence that she
attains.The story itself takes the viewer down a dark path, following the love
between two people from two different worlds. Del Toro was smart with
the balance of action and build up. For just a brief time did the story
feel slow, but it later facets to the build up of later scenes. Although this film wasn't as thrilling as I tend to prefer, it did a
beautiful job of telling a dark love story that held hints of violence,
making it just as enjoyable. I couldn't help but feel that Del Toro paid homage to some of the
classics, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu, and even his
own Pans Labyrinth and Mama with his use of transitions, shadows,
symbolism, and sound.If you're looking for a film that is romantic with a dredge of somber,
makes you uncomfortable yet hopeful, leaves you heartbroken but still
enamored - all while being visually breathtaking, then Crimson Peak
should be at the top of your list.
