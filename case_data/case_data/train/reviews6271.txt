A Stunning Surprise

Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If
there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I
have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough
action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you
actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall
this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a
first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value
and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric
gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb
coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin,
the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the
pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely
bounty hunters Â– a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick
(Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a
great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You
get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to
them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially
Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is
pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was
excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of
the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero
zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough
is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is
for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard
time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the
film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and
genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for
one was thrilled with it. Go see this.
