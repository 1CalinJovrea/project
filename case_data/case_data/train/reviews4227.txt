Beautifully Shot ... But sooooo boring

Well I suppose its a hundred times better than the original ...
Visually amazing ... Well acted by all ... And completely lacking in
story and character ... There is no tension ... There is no atmosphere
at all ... Its just there and SAYING NOTHING ... Vacuous ... Pointless
... Such a waste of such talent ... I suppose the director and
cameraman were glad of the work and will certainly go on to better
things ... Elijah Wood was well crazy to do this ... All credit to him
... He does what he can with it ... And the very thought of America
Olivio as his mum is an outrageous idea :)) ... But the original was
just the same ... Man kills girl, then another, then another etc, then
dies at the end ... Quite frankly that isn't even a storyline ... It
was bad all those years ago and we just watched it cos it was gory ...
And thats what people will do with this ... Watch it once and then
think what a wasted opportunity with that cast and crew ... If only
there was a writer onboard
