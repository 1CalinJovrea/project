Food Fight was better...that's how bad it was.

Here's the thing about propaganda films. If they are bad when
Christians do it (God's Not Dead 1&2, Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas)
they are not going to be better when atheists do it. That's what it
felt like watching this movie. Sausage Party is the God's Not Dead of
an atheist propaganda movie. You are preached at for the entire run
time on why it's bad to believe in a religion, while having to sit
through painfully obvious jokes that don't land. (Oh the douche is a
douche. Hahaha creative) Now before I'm accused of being some whack job
fundamentalist let me say that I hate the other propaganda films. If I
want to watch propaganda I'll go to the source and watch it. Sausage
party is even worse because the trailer doesn't show how preachy it
actually is.It's sad too because the cast is super talented too. (Kroll, Whig,
Cera, Rogan, Hayak) which means that the fault lies solely on the
writing which comes off more as a summer camp sketch than a movie. It
relies way too heavily on recycled racist tropes that were done better
in a 50s Looney Tunes cartoon. That mixed with just yawn worthy sexual
innuendo makes the film unbearable and leaves you praying that the film
ends soon. Which is ironic because that's the opposite of what the film
wants you to do.
