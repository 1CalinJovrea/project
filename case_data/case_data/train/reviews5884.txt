Grim at times but still interesting.

The Survivalist is BAFTA nominated film about a man who is trying to
survive in a post apocalyptic world where food is scarce and where
people will kill to take it from you . He comes across a mother and
daughter and isn't sure he can trust their intentions. This is Grim to
say the least. Not grim in a bad way because the story dictates it
should be that way but it is hard watch at times. It's graphic as well.
Sexually and violently and the characters on display don't say match.
Possibly because they are continuously suspicious of each other or
maybe because of what they have witnessed in the past , words are as
scarce as the food they crave. Good performances from Martin McCann (
we never get to know his name) and Mia Goth add up to an interesting
film that might not be to everyone's taste.
