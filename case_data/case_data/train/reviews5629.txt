Beyond Ridiculous

The dark 1974 movie "The Gambler", starring James Caan, I thought was
the definitive film about compulsive gambling. Although this modern
version gives credit to James Toback (writer of the 1974 movie), I'm
sorry to say I found this film to be beyond ridiculous, with incredibly
stilted and pretentious dialogue, as well as absurd characters and
situations.I will say the acting, given to what they have to work with, is top
notch with Mark Wahlberg leading the way as Jim Bennett, an associate
professor of literature at a college. He comes from an extremely
wealthy family, but is a totally obnoxious, insulting jerk, who
seemingly has a "death wish" regarding his compulsive gambling.Michael Kenneth Williams is also excellent as Neville Baraka, a loan
shark and gambler, while John Goodman gives his usual most solid
performance as Frank, another loan shark and mobster. Poor Brie Larson,
who has to play the role of Amy Phillips here. She's one of Jim's
students, and apparently a genius of a writer, but the more she sees
Jim destroying himself with his gambling she cluelessly becomes even
more attracted to him. Good luck with that!! To me, this was quite the disappointment from two talented filmmakers,
the director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The
Escapist), and the writer William Monahan (The Departed).All in all, I'm sorry to say I found this movie to be far inferior to
the 1970's classic, and a major disappointment for me.
