On par with the first one!

It's pretty easy to review this one. If you liked the first one, you're
in for a treat. It holds up to the expectations and plays cleverly with
'being aware' of making basically the same movie again. The good thing
about this flick is, that it doesn't take itself too seriously while at
the same time delivering a good and fast paced story with quite some
surprises and good action. I basically laughed from the first minute up
to the (awesome!) end credits! If you like that type of comedy, this
one is for you, as it delivers on point and, without a doubt, is the
funniest flick this year so far! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a
great chemistry and you can see and feel, how they enjoyed doing this
movie. Like the first one, 22 Jump Street does a great job observing
the different aspects of college life, students and teachers (or
professors for that matter). Everyone who's been to college can relate
to those stereotypes (e.g. the pseudo intellectuals, the sport jocks,
the art students etc.) and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller
("The Lego Movie") do a great job spoofing those clich√©s while at same
time debunk the downsides and shallowness of those groups or college
life in general. Verdict: Go see it, if you liked the first one. I can't say if it's
better, but it certainly holds up. And I liked the first one pretty
much. So there you go...
