Great comedy/I wanna see it again

Ignore the critics, this movie is great. Really sweet. Hilarious. Adam
Sandler has grown a lot over the years and the critics should give him
break.Loved the setting. Wonderful one liners! Drew and Adam did an amazing
on the movie.Guys and girls and even kids will enjoy it. The kids in my screening
were quoting lines from the movie before we even left the Theater.See it and you will give your belly a good laughter exercise. Good date
movie too and girls night out. Heck the guys will enjoy it too.The writing is incredible! I want to visit the resort it was shot at. If you are looking for a feel good movie, with great one liners, Cherry
on top due to Drew and Adam Sandler's presence, see this.
