Thriiling and exciting

i totally enjoyed this movie, rating should be higher at least 7 or 8.
some scenes are predictable but still worth to watch with popcorn and
drinks. believed me its a good one. amazingly thrilling and exciting i
consider this as one of my 2017 favorite.a beautiful story and twist
with clap clap.
