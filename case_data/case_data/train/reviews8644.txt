Definitely not expecting what I got 10/10

Geostorm is an amazingly brilliant movie. The on screen chemistry
between actors was perfect. The acting itself was perfect. The choice
of actors was perfect. The visuals were amazing and breathtaking. At
points the CGI is very realistic. The storyline was easy to follow and
the ending was unpredictable up until it is revealed. Excellent screen
writing. I look forward to the director's next movie.
