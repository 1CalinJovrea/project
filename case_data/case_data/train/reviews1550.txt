Fail

The scary stuff is pointed at the antagonist. It was good scary stuff.
The antagonist was great (reminded me of Robert Mitchum). Aiming the
scary at the antagonist makes the viewer a disinterested third party.
Had the scary stuff been aimed at a sympathetic protagonist, then -
with all the talent on both sides of the camera in this movie - wowee.
