Fantastic and compelling

I went to see this as part of the London Film Festival on Monday. I
have to say that two days later it still resonates in my mind. Yes,
it's a common tale that has been told in cinema before(man is wrongly
accused and ostracised), but never so well, in my eyes. The acting is
first class with no exception and the cinematography is perfect,
creating a tense mood throughout the film. It's not for the faint
hearted, but I think it's an important subject matter and very current.
I've often wondered what it must be like for someone wrongly accused of
such a crime and the hysteria that surrounds it. I have read reviews
that say this is unrealistic but I don't agree, I only have to look on
my own front doorstep in England to see exactly the same sort of
behaviour, often far far more intense.I highly recommend it.
