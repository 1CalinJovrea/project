DieselIf you've seen the trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy, you'd be
within your rights to think Marvel Studio execs have been hitting the
bottle hard or taking LSD.The film revolves around a group of dysfunctional but goodhearted
criminals  think Robin Hood's Merry Men of the future  comprising
human thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Pratt), green assassin Gamora
(Saldana), talking raccoon Rocket (Cooper), knife-wielding Drax the
Destroyer (Bautista), and walking tree Groot (Diesel).Like the Avengers, the Guardians get off to a false start but soon
unite over a common cause, namely, the galaxy being obliterated by
genocidal maniac, Ronan  not Keating  the Accuser.Ah yes, the old,
let's-exterminate-everyone-for-the-mistakes-of-their-forefathers ploy.But unlike Avengers Assemble, Guardians of the Galaxy oozes offbeat
originality and frankly, it's the most unique and delightful film
Marvel has created to date.It's a hell of an achievement given the extensive movie library the
company is building up and when you consider the characters aren't
household names like 'big three' Iron Man, Thor and Captain America,
but Marvel seems well aware of that fact with the final production
risky to say the least.The film opens in 1988, which is when Quill is abducted from Earth, and
26 years later we see he's become a crooked intergalactic outlaw with a
taste for all things shiny, valuable and not his.Given the distinct decade in which he was taken, his cassette player
and mixtape of 70s and 80s tracks are laced throughout the film, which
creates a quirky yet grounded quality in the midst of all of the
dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way.In addition to the soundtrack, jokes and comedy have never been more of
a feature in a Marvel film  perhaps Iron Man 3 was the closest  as
gags are thrown into the unlikeliest of scenarios to lessen the
tension, and I would imagine, to really differentiate itself from
Avengers Assemble, Star Wars and Star Trek, which by comparison are
left looking very sombre.That said, if you were going to compare Pratt's Quill to someone, the
character is quite reminiscent of Chris Pine's Captain James Kirk 
smart, womanising, reckless leaders, who eventually find their feet.The editing is supreme and makes each bit of dialogue super-sharp and
tight, so when the infamous five are bickering or talking generally,
the repartee all feels really clean and natural without being awkward
or forced.Thor can be stubborn, Iron Man can be arrogant and Captain America is
considered too stiff, but all of the Guardians bring even more wildly
different qualities to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't
ever grate or bore, which wouldn't have been possible without such
excellent casting.Meanwhile, the film is very much in the here and now, with Quill's
backstory the only one that truly gets a look-in, which creates a sense
of intrigue about his colleagues who only have their pasts hinted at,
meaning sequel fodder.There's just no way of knowing where you're going and tonally the movie
delivers a piece of everything and it's done big and without
hesitation.Guardians may have been a gamble, but I'm Grooting for it to Rocket to
the top.10/10
