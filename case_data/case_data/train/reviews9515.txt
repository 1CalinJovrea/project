Disappointing

Waste of money!!I've never felt compelled to leave a review before but my Husband and I
were both very disappointed with this film after both really enjoying
the first 300 movie. I was totally bored 15 minutes in but was hoping for something
interesting to happen- it never happened!I felt like it was all action/graphics but no story line, the entire
film was people getting killed with swords in slow motion, ships
bashing into each other like the dodgems and then there was Sullivan
Stapleton's bad British accent which was a mixture between British,
American and Australian.
