creature feature bitten with revenge

Have heard that Bite was a juicy flick and I agree, the puss and juice
is all over the picture. It all starts rather easy and no horror is to
catch the first 20 minutes. Again I thought that this was going to be a
flick about forbidden love and love affairs but was I wrong. Once the
bug has bitten this flick turns into a straight horror.It will remind you a lot of The Fly (1986) due the transformation
taking place but it can't tip that flick. Still it isn't that bad after
all. It doesn't become gory but what it do does getting messy. Once the
girl turns into a bug her saliva turns into a killng device. It becomes
acid to solve human skin. It is also a bit of a revenge flick too
because throughout the flick it's shown what happened at her stag
night.If you like creature features then this will satisfy you if you think
you will see gore galore leave it. I liked it, above mediocre.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5
