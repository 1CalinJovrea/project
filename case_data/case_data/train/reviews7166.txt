Idiotic. Dumb. Sad.

OK, the whole movie is hanging on the idea that in future spaceship
engineers and designers are complete morons.First of all, the shape of the spaceship. Come on. Secondly, no one
ever will send 5000 people on a 120 year journey without the crew
rotating in and out of hibernation precisely for the purpose of
managing the emergencies. That would be insane on many levels, yet this
is the premise of the movie.Thirdly, in Space everything has a backup, or you die. It's fricking
Space. But in our case if your hibernation pod malfunctions you can't
go back into hibernation. Because pods are "fail-proof". "Cant' break".
It would've been my first question at the presentation, "Um, sorry, but
if my pod craps out, is there a way to put me back into sleep? And will
there be anyone on duty to do it? What? No and no? Really? OK, thank
you, good bye."On a psychological level "Passengers" makes even less sense. If someone
literally ruins your life and all your hopes, you don't forgive him and
live happily ever after with him. Doesn't happen. Could've been a cool
stalker/survival horror movie, but no, screenwriters aren't smart
enough to pull something like that off.One more thing - if you're directly at the exhaust hatch of a huge
thermonuclear reactor when that hatch opens - you die. Movie ends right
there. Unless screenwriters are idiots. Then you live.Also if you pass that close to a star its gravity sucks you in. And if
it doesn't, then you spaceship is built using a whole new set of
physics laws, and then why does it take you 120 years to get from point
A to point B in the first place?This movie is by stupid people for stupid people. Tons of missed
opportunities. Good leads. But stupid people, stupid people everywhere.
