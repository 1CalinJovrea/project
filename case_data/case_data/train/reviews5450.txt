What to Expect: Prisoners

Why You Might Like It: I can go on and on about the good things in this
film and why most viewers will enjoy it. It has an outstanding cast
that play their parts well, the directing and cinematography are
gripping, and the story is something to marvel. This is an excellent
film that I highly recommend.Why You Might Not Like It: I don't know why anyone wouldn't enjoy the
movie. It does run over 2 hours, so some movie-goers might think that
is a bit too long, but I don't think this movie will lose anyone's
interest.Acting/Casting: 9.5* - As mentioned, the casting and acting is
outstanding. Hugh Jackman gives the best performance of his career in
my opinion. Paul Dano is downright creepy and plays his part to a tee.
Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and the rest of the cast
do great work as well.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 8.5* - Let me just say that Denis
Villeneuve has made his mark in the US after this one. The directing in
this movie is gripping and pulls the viewer in from start to finish. I
can't say enough about all of the small things that go into making the
atmosphere in the movie amazing (the weather, the buildings, music,
etc.) Plot/Characters: 8.5* - This is arguably one of the better
abduction/kidnapping stories that I have seen. The plot is deep and has
many layers that keep the viewer guessing all the way up until the very
end. There is no doubt that the story plays a huge role in the final
product that you see on the screen.Entertainment Value: 9* - It keeps you guessing throughout and on the
edge of your seat from start to finish. Movies like this are why we go
to the movies. Get out and see it.My Score: 9.5+8.5+8.5+9 = 35.5/4 = 8.875 Email your thoughts to
