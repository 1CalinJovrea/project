Could someone retire this series, Disney and Scarlet johansson?

I know there is like four of these Marvel films a year and they are
really not worth reviewing, but I have really come to loath the generic
by-the-numbers Disneyfied Marvel. Someone just retire the whole thing.And mostly the ever so useless Scarlet Johansson. isn't there enough
Jewish middle aged stepmother films out there for her to go do those
and leave her useless presence in 'action' films to someone more
qualified?? Can't she go whitewash Japanese or pretend she is hot and
find a 'girls are partying movie' or something? Anything?? Marvel is as
unhip and boring now as Ishtar or JJ Abrams reboots of Star Wars so I
and many other should look for some quality somewhere else.
