Gripping drama

I have no doubt this movie will pick up a lot of Oscars in the
technical categories, but will miss out on acting. That's not to say
it's badly acted, but it is the story itself that is so compelling.The soundtrack and cinematography are just amazing! And the 3D IMAX
really add to the spectacle of the whole experience.I think you need a combination of courage and madness to take on
Everest as it has been the final resting place of many a climber. You
are in awe of the majesty of this mountain. Whether you make it or not
isn't just dependent on your experience as a climber, you are at the
mercy of the elements that can change dramatically within a few hours.You don't have to have an interest in climbing to appreciate this
movie. This drama is based on actual events. The pace and direction are
very good. You don't learn a whole lot about many of the characters,
but they all have the same goal and ambition. I admire their courage,
but I like my adrenalin in a controlled environment at Cedar Point,
Ohio!!!! If this movie subject appeals to you, it is well worth seeing
- and you should also check out the docu-drama Touching The Void!
