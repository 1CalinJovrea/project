Top Gear as an Action movie

Had to laugh quite hard at the end: A Car gets hit by a Truck, the car
flies away in the air for like 2.3 seconds, then suddenly explodes in a
heavy fireball. One of the best Actionmovie endings I've seen so far.The rest is basically just a show-off of expensive car with a lame
action story. Its OK to watch but nothing special. Has some weird
Italian Jobs like twists, but they didn't fully reveal the whole twist
in the end, or i just didn't understand. Anyway, doesn't matter. Action
boom boom, cars, works for me.
