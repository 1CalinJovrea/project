A fantastic sci-fi experience

I very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland
I've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative
reviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from
beginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible,
reviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to
slate this movie for their own specific reasons. The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless
possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in
the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were
incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the
pace.Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the
negative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the
chance. Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something
consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination,
or the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you
want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV
actors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or
write because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science
is dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope.As for me...I loved it. I'll be watching it again and again :-)One of
the best movies of 2015, and now on my "favourite movie" list.
