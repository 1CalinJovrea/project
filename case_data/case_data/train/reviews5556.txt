The Campaign...2.5 out of 4 Skittles

t seems like it should be easy to make a funny movie about the state of
our political climate.rich, greedy, corrupt people spending millions
of dollars to make television ads that spread blatant lies to the
uninformed voting public, but The Campaign ends up feeling a bit
underwhelming of what could have been.Screenwriters Chris Henchy & Shawn Harwell only scratched the surface
of the real life hilarity of the current political landscape. All they
had to do was turn on any TV news channel and take note of the circus
that current politics have becomefrom former governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger to Weiner-Gate towellSarah Palin, but for Chris
Henchy, the writer of past stinkers Land of the Lost and The Other
Guys, I guess that is what should be expected.Will Ferrell (Step Brothers, Anchorman) and Zach Galifianakis (The
Hangover, Due Date) make a fine comedic duo, but their one-note
characters leave these candidates without much to say. Ferrell ends up
doing a less funny version of his George W. Bush impersonation. His
iconic character was a slam-dunk on short SNL skits, but runs thin in a
feature film.The Campaign definitely provides its share of laughs that keep this
film above average, but doesn't live up to other classic films produced
by Ferrell and Adam McKay's Gary Sanchez production companyI.E. Step
Brothers, Anchorman, Talladega Nights. The Campaign may end up being
one of the most profitable comedies of the 2012 blockbuster season, but
compared against the other duds Hollywood barfed out this summer (The
Watch, That's My Boy, The Dictator) that isn't saying too much.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com
