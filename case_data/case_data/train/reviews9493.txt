Fashion's revenge

Based on the best-selling novel by Rosalie Ham, this comedy-drama is
set in early 1950's Australia. It's a vibrant tale of revenge, mother-
daughter bonds, small-town secrets and the great power of clothes, in a
movie that is both bittersweet and funny and is dominated by a
stunning, multi-layered performance from Kate Winslet. Jocelyn
Moorhouse's latest feature is enjoyable enough and so unexpected, and
let's be honest she also has a great team to help her achieve that. In
few words, "The Dressmaker" is a dark comedy in Australian style, that
will catch many by surprise, especially if you love clothes and fashion
in general. nikisreviews.com
