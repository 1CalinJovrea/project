Oh dear

This film is hilariously bad. I brought it back for me and my
girlfriend, and we watched it. This film really tried to pull off the
'omg-look-behind-you' and
'im-really-stupid-so-im-not-going-to-pick-up-that-gun'-type mentatily.
I understand this is part of the Horror genre that i so love, but..
this is ridiculous to the point to making fun of you. Because of this,
you will probably want to shut it off about 2/3 through, by that stage
the shitness couldn't bring me to care about the already weak
characters any more anyway, unfortunately. Started so well. What a
shame.
