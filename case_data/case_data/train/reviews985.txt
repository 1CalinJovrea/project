Horrible acting and script make for a terrible sequel

I thought the first Silent Hill movie was rather decent. How does this
sequel compare to it? Well, it is utterly horrible. The dialogue is extremely clunky and lacks all subtlety. Kit Harrington
(Vincent) and Adelaide Clemens (Heather) are absolutely horrible in
this. They also look way too old to be in high school to be believable.
The interaction and the dialogue is just so awkward and forced. There's
no natural flow to it. It's rare to find it so bad even in a bad movie.
Partly it must be the director's fault because Kit is pretty good in
Game of Thrones. You can't help but shake your head when you watch Vincent react calmly
and unquestionably to all the crazy stuff Heather starts to talk about.
"Oh, a demon child and people trying to resurrect old gods? Well, OK
then". And the reveal about Vincent around the half- hour mark? Wow,
just wow. So horribly written and acted. Everything is just resolved so
suddenly. Like the scene with Vincent's grandfather. Suddenly he's
turned into a monster and he's carrying Heather. Oh no, what's going to
happen to her! The suspense! Nah, she just takes the medallion from
inside the monster and that's it. The visuals and the sets are kind of OK. The iconic Silent Hill fog was
done nicely. Pyramidhead and the nurses were well done. They clearly
used most of the movie's budget on the CGI. But the horror in this film
was pretty much only cheap scares. I don't care that much for those
because I think the horror should mainly come from the atmosphere. This
movie's atmosphere doesn't remind me in the slightest of the times when
I was playing these games all those years ago. Very disappointed in
this film. It was mind-bendingly boring. And I liked the first one,
everything was just done so much better in that one.
