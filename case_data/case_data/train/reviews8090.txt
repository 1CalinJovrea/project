Where is the promised WAR? Why is the movie so slow?

If you've not seen War of the Planet of Apes, here's a Warning: THERE
IS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! What exist are just skirmishes between humans and the imprisoned apes
who were trying to escape.In fact, it is a FLOP movie! Only 15 people were watching the show.The first 75% of the movie is very, very slow and the movie is 30
minutes too long (actual length is 2hr 20 mins). This is because the
story-writer hopelessly failed to think of ways to add Thrill and a
real War  but, instead, made the plot move at a snails' pace just to
elongate the movie time.In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes.
Not a second more.The movie ends in an "unconvincing" manner: One military faction is
eliminated by another military group. And this group is eliminated by a
roaring Avalanche. This helps the apes to escape to the dessert they
were planning to relocate on.NOTE: The Avalanche was created because the story-writer could not
think of a way for the apes to attack and defeat the military faction.
How Convenient! LOL! The only great thing about this movie is the CGI which makes the apes
look 100% realistic. The Avalanche too looks realistic. The visuals and
cinematography is great.WPA is an extremely "unconvincing" end to a trilogy whose first 2
episodes are just Moving & Thrilling  which touched your heart and
mind. They made you feel for each of the characters.I feel like giving TIGHT SLAPS across the faces of Writers Matt Reeves
and Mark Bomback, just as I felt like giving the same to Roland
Emmerich for Independence Day 2.
