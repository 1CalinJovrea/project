The end didn't come soon enough

Here's a date movie if you never want to see that date again.Does indoor soccer with a severed head strike you funny? Screaming
about a soiled porn magazine when there is no food or water?Nobody works too hard playing themselves and their perceived on screen
image, except Jonah Hill when he's doing Linda Blair. That's about when
the movie elevates from foul talking humor to more effective use of the
movie format.Parts of the movie look like it was shot on a cell phone. The monsters
seemed borrowed from "Ghostbusters", a far better movie. The script
like Franco's pop-up television seemed like it had been sitting around
and was not fresh or current.There are laughs, but at times it looked like even the cast was
embarrassed by some of what was happening. The movie will be enjoyed
most by those on mind dulling drugs.
