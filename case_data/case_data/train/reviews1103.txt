Perfect example of everything wrong with movies these days.

OK so we have nepotistic casting? Check. We have actors desperate to be
leading ones even though they can never carry a movie? Check. A trailer
that reveals the whole movie/predictable/no suspense ending. Check. A
unrealistic plot by any stretch of the imagination? Check. The whole
movie is dedicated solely to launch there actors careers/not about the
actual plot? Check.Yeah I mean this would have been an acceptable movie to just watch and
not expect much out of it. But it was so painful to watch, as per the
reasons listed above. The movie was SO irritating!Lily Collins, people like your face too bad you can't act. Very telling
is that she actually auditioned for the role of Bella Swan in Twilight!
Meaning giving blank stares and not actually acting. Dare I say I need
to give Kristen Stewart some credit next to Lily she can act up a
storm.I kid you not, whole SCENES were her making BLANK stares. And this was
supposed to emit 'emotion'? Yeah that just emits that you can't act.
Also her hair being in her face, are you kidding me?The rest of the actors do what they can with what they have. But when
the plot makes such little sense, you can't really do much. I mean they
went though so much and still they did not get together? What? I mean
ONE of the things that happened to them would/should have sent them
into each others arms. So why did that not happen? Oh right check the
list "unrealistic plot". Also if they got together there would be no
movie.That's another reason this movie is so tedious. It's not over until
they get together. Wow talk about waiting for the Jeopardy music to
end. So stupid.Another thing I resented was the sound levels. Their words are whisper
quiet. Then there is blasting loud music. Did an intern do the sound
mixing?So sad this formulaic 'career launching' torture got so much funding
but better movies don't.
