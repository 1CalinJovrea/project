More annoying than funny!!

I am not a fussy person when it comes to movies and I was irritated by
this one within less than 20 minutes!! I found Amy Schumer's character
pretty vulgar and crude...and not in a funny way. The first eight
minutes of listening to her, really made me want to turn the movie off
and it takes a lot for me to feel that way, kind of like nails down a
chalkboard. She also portrays her character very superficially, which
normally does not bother me too much, however when it's coupled with
unnecessary cursing every 2 minutes, along with a vulgar tongue...it
doesn't come across well. Vulgar is not funny, especially in women!
It's trying too hard to try and be funny. Tilda Swinton's character was
even worse, she was obnoxious and also vulgar, two very difficult
qualities that make it hard to watch.I did not laugh once (and I laugh at most comedies) and did not enjoy
any part of it!!
