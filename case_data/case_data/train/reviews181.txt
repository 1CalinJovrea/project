Not What I Expected

Let me start by saying that I did not expect this movie to play out the
way it did. The acting by Noomi Rapace is nothing but phenomenal. The
movie does have the basic, typical plot in regards to the whole
dystopia and one child policy that has been seen before. However, the
notion of the seven sisters working together to survive was what made
this storyline unique. Although Noomi played seven roles, each
character had the chance of sharing their story and distinctive traits.
I definitely recommend this movie. Netflix pulled this movie out of a
hat.
