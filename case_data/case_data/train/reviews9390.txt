Technicially Great  But Depressing

August: Osage County had chick flick written all over it and I couldn't
wait to see it. Technically I suppose it was very good. It tells the
story of the Weston family and the aftermath of their father's suicide.
Meryl Streep is very good in her completely unlikeable character of
Violet Weston who emotionally abuses her own family. Julia Roberts is
also very good as daughter Barbara alongside Dermot Mulroney who plays
the potential new brother in law and is surprise surprise a real jerk.
There are some great actors in smaller roles such as Misty Upham as the
family's cook. It has all of the right ingredients but I was
disappointed. Nothing goes right for this family and it is draining
watching their life fall apart. Nothing is resolved either. Don't get
me wrong, I don't regret seeing it but I probably won't remember it
either. There are better films around at the moment.
