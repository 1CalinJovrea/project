John Wick is coming for you with his gun and pencil

John Wick 2 is a great sequel that wasn't underwhelming it produced
great action scenes great performances and there wasn't a dull moment
in sight, its more fast paced than the first but all in good favor,
Keanu Reeves gives it his all and adds a lot to these movies I'm
hopeful that this continues on to be a great franchise, we got are
first peek into the mob underworld in the first movie and in this movie
its more fleshed and we get to know more about wick as the story
progresses as I said it adds more to the story in every aspect which is
to be praised. I also believe that the action set pieces in this movie topped its
predecessor with stunts where you tilt your head in amazement. Only
negatives sometimes the movie doesn't take time to stop and let you
have a breather but otherwise its a very impressive movie with great
acting, story and action sequences. JOHN WICK YOUR NOT VERY GOOD AT
RETIRING!!
