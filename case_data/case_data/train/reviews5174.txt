Gritty western/horror hybrid really delivers the goods

BOME TOMAHAWK is a really good western/horror movie that features
exemplary direction from an unknown director and great performances
from the small cast. It terms of plot it's nothing special, a 19th
century reworking of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, but it's the execution that
makes this such a great movie. Despite a two and a quarter hour running
time the film is hugely suspenseful and soaked in a gritty, disturbing
atmosphere.I'd heard reports of this being a gore fest but it's no such thing;
there are a handful of brutal moments but mainly this is a mood piece.
The descent into a kind of hell is reminiscent of the likes of
APOCALYPSE NOW and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and the every scene is carefully
composed to add maximum depth and tension. The desert landscapes look
fantastic, and the violence is all the more impactful for being used
sparingly.Cast-wise, Kurt Russell headlines the show and is quite brilliant, as
usual; it's nice to see him being used properly after his turn in the
lacklustre HATEFUL EIGHT (and boy, Tarantino could sure learn a thing
or two from this film). Patrick Wilson does his dedicated everyman
performance and is likable with it, and Matthew Fox is a real surprise
as the brash and arrogant fellow who gets you on side regardless.
Richard Jenkins, as the old timer, somehow keeps the whole thing
together. As with the recent MAGNIFICENT SEVEN remake, BONE TOMAHAWK
breathes new life into the almost forgotten western genre, making it
worthy once more. I can't wait to watch it again.
