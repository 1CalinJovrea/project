Fine cast, failure of a script

The fine cast assembled for this film makes me wonder what they saw in
the script. Was it a matter of one actor signing on, and others wanting
to work with him (I say him because the only female in the film is Zoe
Saldana, in a one-dimensional and thankless role). Was it that the
director used to be an actor and knows all these people? Was it because
he had success with Crazy Heart?Other reviews basically already touch on the problems here: it means
nothing. I wanted to like the film, but I walked out of the theater not
knowing what I had just seen (the ending is confusing, ridiculous, and
poorly done). The film takes itself far too seriously to get away with
just being entertaining, and when you don't have a clue what the whole
point of the movie was, that's a bad thing. Things happen in the film
without really coming together and create a cohesive narrative where
you feel that there's any growth or direction. Perhaps that's the
intent, but any theme or themes were underdeveloped and not apparent. I
find the comparisons to Deerhunter insulting, personally.The actors do a fine job, although I feel there is some miscasting in
the movie. Would Forest Whitaker really be able to attract Zoe Saldana?
Nothing in the movie gave me any reason to think they had a believable
relationship. Frankly, nothing in the film convinced me that Saldana
would even stay in a town like Braddock. Bale is good, as is Affleck
and Harrelson, but I didn't really connect with anyone except Affleck's
character. Definitely a missed opportunity and a disappointment.
