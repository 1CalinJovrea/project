Zombie blockbuster for a generic audience

I haven't read the book so I'm not coming from viewing this as an
adaptation but rather a stand-alone film. (From what I've heard it's
pretty far from the original source anyway.) First off, a zombie film
watered-down and free from blood and gore? That idea alone would lose a
big slice (pun-intended) of hardcore fans in the audience. How does it
hold your attention then? By stringing you along on the edge with
tension and suspense from beginning to end. It does a pretty good job
of maintaining this grip even without the standard horror elements of
slasher flicks.Brad Pitt easily slips into the role of a family man desperate to keep
his family safe. It's not difficult to root for him and share in his
urgency. His charm certainly makes up for and saves the movie from its
flaws (and there are many!) not the least of which are its gaping plot
holes and loose direction.The audience in the theater seemed to have fun screaming along and
allowing themselves to be entertained and toyed with. There are a
handful of funny scenes (whether intentional or not). If you're willing
to quit analyzing the movie like a critic, you'll probably start
enjoying it.After all, when did a zombie movie ever have to be "BELIEVABLE"?
