I hate hate hate Clowns!!

While this is a highly interesting idea to a movie, and some aspects of
the movie was generally terrifying. All in all in didn't quite do it
for me, yes there are the totally creepy clowns that scare the absolute
hell out of me, but I felt this movie could have done so much better.Yet another found footage movie that was lacking in one or two major
things. The climactic section is a letdown, however, the promise raised by
scattered creepy earlier moments (when unwelcome masked phantoms
repeatedly appear outside the RV) undeserved by hectic jerky-cam panic
and a lot of running around.While I would say it is worth the watch, I would't run to the the
cinema to watch it again.
