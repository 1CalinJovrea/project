Original approach to the Vampire mythos which is more an examination of being human.

Byzantium is more a study of being human than being vampire and holds
the attention easily with strong lead performances. At the center is
actually a mother daughter relationship, a question of nature versus
nurture and survival. As well as all the vices of humankind thrown in
for good measure. In this movie the vampires are all human, albeit
changed and remain human, albeit enhanced but at a cost and within the
shadows of normal living. Life and death of course are issues and
living,if we could live forever would we rise above what we are?
Questions within. Really enjoyed this and good to see Saiorse Ronan
back on form after that terrible Alien outing. Gemma Arterton also puts
in a great performance. This is billed as a vampire movie however I'd
recommend it to anyone as although the elements are there its very far
from what you'd expect of a movie of that genre.
