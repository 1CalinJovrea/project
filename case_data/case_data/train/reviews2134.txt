What movie did those guys watch?

I really don't understand all the hate this movie gets. Yeah, I get it,
it's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted,
but it's a really good one! I expected a mindless Micheal Bayian action
movie and what I got was a really smart, interesting and entertaining
look at trans-humanism, the freedom of choice, politics and
recklessness in corporate leaders.This movie really dives into the question of how a person could live
his day to day live with almost all of his body amputated and stuck
inside of a machine. So when people complain about the uncomfortable
scenes between Murphy and his wife, I can only imagine they mean what
happened after his transformation, and that felt exactly the way it was
supposed to!So yes, the original is way more graphic and still holds up to this day
as a gruesome action flick, but this one is smart and interesting and
really is a good movie in it's own right.And by no means is it as bad as people say it is!
