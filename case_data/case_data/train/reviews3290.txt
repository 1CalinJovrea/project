The Eyes Are The Windows Of The Soul?? - Yeah? Says Who??

Of the many "Tim Burton" films that I've seen over the years - To date,
"Big Eyes" has got to be the stinkiest one of them all. In my opinion -
This utter piece of bio-junk was strictly bottom of the barrel
entertainment.Without question, "Big Eyes" was one of the worst examples of
big-budget ($10 million), Hollywood storytelling in recent years. This
film's subject matter was literally milked completely dry.I mean, Big Eyes' tale could've easily been wrapped up in about 60
minutes, instead of a tedious 106. Like, talk about flogging a dead
horse.And, as far as its 2 principal actors go - Amy Adams (?) - Yet another one-dimensional, Nicole Kidman-type who was
awful-awful-awful. I swear that I could literally see this woman
thinking through her dialogue before she actually spoke it.Christoph Waltz (?) - From start to finish, a talentless and total
scenery chewer. This guy's gutless, over-the-top portrayal of Walter
Keane made me absolutely cringe.Anyway - As far as I'm concerned - It's two big, black eyes for "Big
Eyes" - (Boo! Hiss! to Tim Burton)
