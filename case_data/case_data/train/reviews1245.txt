Made me feel ashamed

CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM THE STARTJust seen this last night, and i felt it deserved a few words from me
as it made me feel so angry and ashamed to come from the "west". An
awful lot of people died in this tragedy yet they happen to make a film
about a western family of 5 and they all survive, and to top it all off
they fly off in what is essentially a private flight out of the country
at the end. It was soppy beyond belief, the acting was second class,
with the child actor playing Thomas saying lines that were so
unbelievable and contrived. As a film it certainly had me thinking, to
the point that i had to have my say, i honestly can't recommend this to
anyone. There must have been so many tragic stories from this event, to
put this forward as representative of this event is insulting to all
those that have suffered.
