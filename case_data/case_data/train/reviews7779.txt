And now Lars von Trier has destroyed the sex itself

I have written quite exhaustive review of this movie but Socialist
State of IMDb kinda prohibits some words - but in a very Kafkaesque
manner does not explain which ones. That's somewhat unfortunate as the
movie Nymphomaniac can only be described by words that describe some
mature content activities. I mean some really depraved mature content
activities.Even though there is a lot of mature activity going around in this four
hour long movie it is also unbelievably dull and boring. It is really
hard to describe four hours long intellectual exchange so to speak
between utterly depraved female character that seems to ask for
understanding and her supposed intellectual savior. Philosophy, music,
arts, the topics you would expect to be discussed between an old loner
and insane sex addict - at least if you are modern intellectual
leftist. It is so excruciatingly boring, long and really painful to
watch. I kinda loved early Trier works like Kingdom Hospital but this is just
beyond horrible. The main female character is supposed to be some sort
of female suffering from masculine and capitalist oppression, but she
only abuses others - males, females, her own son, everyone. Its sick
character only getting sicker as movie progresses. There is no resolution at the end, no salvation, no conclusion, no
mercy, no atonement, not a single spark of light at the end of the
tunnel. The main heroine is simply sick psychopath who should be
treated at the closed psychiatric ward as she descends just from from
perverted to simply dangerous and evil.
