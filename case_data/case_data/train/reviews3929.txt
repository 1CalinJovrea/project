Well done!

I was really skeptical going in, but having seen it, I have to say it
was frigging AWESOME! Loved every second of it! SO worth the money!
Finally something taking Bourne back in business! Bourne Ultimatum was
just OK because of the constant stupid camera shaking that just made me
mad so I did not enjoy that movie. The camera shaking was just too
much. It made it very hard to follow the movie. This one tho was just
smooth and cool! Well done Tony! Having said that I would have liked
that Matt would have made at least a cameo Its sad and unprofessional
for Matt do take a stance like that. "I will only do Bourne with Paul"
What are you twelve?". Matt you are the coolest guy on earth, but Tony
made a better Bourne then Paul did with the last two.I really hope Renner and Damon will be in the next Bourne and Tony
Gilroy directing!
