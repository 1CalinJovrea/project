Ronan owns this films, terrific performance

I was lucky enough to get tickets to a preview of Brooklyn last week,
and in a rare change from the normal routine, I went into a film
knowing absolutely nothing about it. It was such a full house, that I ended up staring up at the screen from
well outside my usual comfort zone at an awkward angle, too close to
the screen, and away from my girlfriend which wasn't a great start, but
once the film started I was quickly caught up in the magnificence of
Saoirse Ronan's performance and forgot about any of those minor gripes.Ronan owned this film, from first to last. The storyline itself is a
somewhat thin and a follows a well-trodden path but Ronan gives it such
heft, and brings the intensity of her character's experience and
development full force such that any deficiencies of the story seem
inconsequential. It was only after leaving the screening that I really
looked back at some of the plot points and realised how contrived it
had been in places, but for the time I was watching it, I was simply
living it through the potency of the acting. Ronan was brilliant in
this, and I struggle to think of any recent performances that can match
this for the confidence and sure-footedness that she showed. I think
she's in with a good shout for an award or two for this role.It's worth mentioning Julie Waters as well, who reliably entertains and
impresses in all she does. Between her and Saoirse Ronan, they made
sure that Brooklyn passed the 6 laugh test Â– and also the 6 cry test. I
laughed, and cried, and laughed as I was crying, and cried as I was
laughing pretty much throughout the whole film. A thoroughly enjoyable
film, where the central performance takes the audience on an engrossing
and emotional trip through an otherwise somewhat slight storyline.
