So so so so very disappointed

Horrible; in my opinion.I love all of these actors, and I love all the movies they play
in...Hell I even went to the movie stoned thinking it would make it
even funnier. Nope.I honestly think I laughed MAYBE 5 times...Emma Watson was my favorite
part of the whole movie...Well and Channing Tatum, that was kinda
hilarious.But really, so disappointed by this movie. 2 friends fell asleep, and
another friend and myself kept giving each other this look like "Wtf
are we watching..Is it over yet??" Go see it if you dare, no one can
tell you what to like and what not to like...But just know, you may be
extremely disappointed like my friends & I were.
