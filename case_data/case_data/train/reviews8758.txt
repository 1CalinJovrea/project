Blair Witch meets Deliverance for the Deliveroo generation.

A lads night out turns terrible when Robert is mindlessly mugged &
killed during an off licence robbery. A few months later the remaining
pals venture on a memorial hike in the Swedish wilderness where they
encounter a bunch of weirdos in the woods worshipping a fantastical
ancient beast who's full freaky form isn't displayed until the final
moments. It's Blair Witch meets Deliverance for the Deliveroo
generation.
