As boring and emotionless as twilight

Was lifeless, characters had no emotion or personality , found myself
rooting for gaston, he was the only cool one. Modern autotuned garbage.
CGI was awful and way overdone. Nothing like the original. Songs were
long and annoying. Dialogue felt rushed like they tried to cram all the
stuff from the original into it but ran out of time.
