Brilliant

I highly recommend the Netflix movie Boys in the Trees... it reminds me
of being little, of adventure, of not being afraid... a beautiful,
refreshing movie about Halloween and growing up. Check it out.Such a heartfelt, perfect movie, I haven't seen such a innocent and
meaningful horror film since Lady in White.
