Guy Ritchie is much better in something else

Guy Ritchie, in my opinion, should better stay with his genres and not
touch history. Neither characters are represented well nor atmosphere
is created. All famous Ritchie's tricks are not fit for the story like
this, where the atmosphere is much more important than jumps and
fighting. Many banal patterns which completely do not fit with the
ancient England. I don't think there were "cool" guys talking with each
other as rappers in that time. The movie is an expensive fail.
