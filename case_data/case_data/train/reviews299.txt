Excellent horror movie!

I personally think this movie is one of the greatest horror movies
ever! Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman's acting is very good,
absolutely credible, almost like Rosa Byrne's performance in Insidious,
which was flawless. The cinematography was good, dark scenes pretty
clear, intense sound effects well achieved.If you go to the cinema with your childhood fears, you will really
enjoy this movie. It's full of scares and if you put attention to them,
they are the kind of scares that you really fear when you are a kid.I don't understand why people cannot leave their critics-attitude at
home and simply enjoy this movie or any other movie. If they do it,
you'll enjoy it a lot.
