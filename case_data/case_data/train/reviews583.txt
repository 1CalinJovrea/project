So much wrong with this film.

I really liked Maze runner, but still don't understand why they didn't
just build a ladder to the top of the wall and walk out. This movie was
full of WTF stupid moments that really bugs me.Like why didn't they just turn off the generator when they noticed that
that's what brought the zombies to life?! Instead they just leave it on
and like Monty Pithon they run away, run away!When Brenda and Thomas see that creepy growing red stuff on the walls
of the sewer, anyone else, after all they have been through would have
taken one look and said nope, I'm outta here, but instead they have to
go fully investigate this dangerous looking creepy stuff. They could
have found a better way to have Brenda get infected.When Thomas makes an impossible heroic save of Brenda from falling to
the ground through the glass, are we really supposed to assume they had
no trouble at all getting back to the doorway above and clear from
danger?!When that guy is shooting the big gun off the back of the truck, first
of all he is a horrible shot not able to hit a huge helicopter and
second, why didn't he shoot the transport before the kids got on it.
All the bad people were on it and ripe for the killing and yet he does
nothing. I also thought Mary's character was way too short lived. Brenda and
Thomas relationship was not played out well enough and I really don't
like Teresa. Traitor bitch ;) Also couldn't they find a better song
than After Midnight? AC/DC or Disturbed or something that sounded like
destruction would have made for a better scene. I have not read the books, but maybe the film would be better if they
hadn't heavily diverted away. Either way I think it was lazily written
and I want my $6 back! Lol
