Not what i expected

First of all.. I've seen Jobs with Ashton Kutcher and it wasn't that
bad as everyone said and i personally think it was much more
interesting than this one.Steve Jobs was entertaining.. yes, but it was difficult to follow the
plot. After watching the Movie i had no clue what Steve actually did, i
mean i know some things, but i've learned nothing about his life after
seeing this Movie. The only thing that this Movie brought to me was the
Fact that he sucked as a Father and as a Human. Do i know why he did
all this?...no.In the End this Movie opened a lot of questions but none of them
getting answered and this is the reason why i think i didn't liked it
that much.Yes the acting was great and all, but i hope it's not just me who
thinks that a Movie needs more than just good acting.. Would you like to see the invention of Apple and what Steve Jobs done
for it, watch the one with Ashton Kutcher...If you like to see a Movie about Steve Jobs personal life without any
real answers to it, watch this Movie...
