Excellent movie

I am absolutely amazed with this film. This is definitely not one of
the "typical American love story" that are nowadays too popular. Of
course, there are some standard things that must appear in the genre of
these films, but it is obvious that they really made an effort. During
the film, you can be surprised with unexpected events that are actually
much more realistic than in the standard romantic movies. The trail of
missed opportunities, which is constantly repeated in this film, keeps
viewers under some kind of tension, or so it seemed to me. As a matter
of fact, I'm not a huge fan of romantic drama, because they put lots of
unnecessary events and drama in the film, but this movie, I would
definitely recommend anyone who likes movies that bounce from other
films.
