Technically competent, but sadly just as likely to bore you into a flatline as the defibrillators used in the film.

To say that this dull, dreary and repetitive picture is conceptually
questionable is to kindly downplay the sheer nonsensicality of its
disoriented and incohesive plot, which feels like an amalgamation of
two or three separate narratives carelessly and callously forced into
the constraints of a single narrow-minded frame, though even this could
perhaps be forgiven if the poorly paced piece provided a glimmer of
genuine entertainment at any point, as opposed to the detached and
passive experience that stemmed mainly from the fact that I developed
absolutely no attachment to the unlikable and unintelligent characters;
while it is mostly a technically competent film, with the scare
sequences in particular being confidently crafted (if generic) and the
music being occasionally inspired, I was never properly engaged with
the piece and by the time a sequence which could be considered
interesting rolled around, I was already so truly bored that nothing
could pull me out of my almost comatose state, amounting to a feature
that is so generic, monotonous and generally mediocre that it's almost
painful. 4/10
