Nuanced commentary on modern society

Set against the beautiful Pacific Northwest backdrop, Captain Fantastic
is easily one of the most nuanced films to come to mainstream cinema in
the last few years. It's main plot addresses the struggle when everyone
has the best intentions but not the same values. Additionally, the film
makes honest and straightforward comments on controversial issues in
today's society that are often taboo in the media such as mental
illness, the hypocrisy of children's exposure to violence and sex,
religion, and the flaws in the American education system. This sounds
heavy and uncomfortable but these issues are paralleled in such a way
that parts of the film had us in tears; from laughing so hard. Director
Matt Ross says the project started as an exaggerated exploration of the
difficult choices that must be made in regards to raising children in
today's society. I think the film goes a step further and awakens an
internal dialogue in each of it's viewers about the way that we live
our own lives based on societal influences. Furthermore, the
performances given by the perfectly arranged cast enhance your
investment in the story in a way that will cause you to question what
right and wrong really are when you're only trying to do your best and
do what you think is best for those that you love.
