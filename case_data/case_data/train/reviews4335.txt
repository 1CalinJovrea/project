Julia Roberts, Nathan Lane, and Lilly Collins are pretty good in the fairy tale spoof Mirror Mirror

Just watched this fairy tale spoof of a movie with my movie
theatre-working friend. Julia Roberts plays the Evil Queen who wants
Snow White (Lilly Collins) killed but her henchman (Nathan Lane) is
very reluctant to do so. Ms. White eventually falls in with
some...well, let's just say diminutive warriors and a prince (Armie
Hammer) who's being tricked into marrying the queen. What the queen
does to make him fall for her is the most hilarious thing in the movie.
Nothing is as funny as what I just mentioned but there's a fun
atmosphere throughout even during the more intense dramatic parts. And
check out the Bollywood number that ends the whole thing! Really, I'll
just say that Mirror Mirror is very much worth a look.
