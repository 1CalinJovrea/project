Wow that was good!

I love it. It answers the question, what happens when you put THE
BREAKFAST CLUB, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and EVIL DEAD in a blender.
You get this awesome movie from the makers of CORALINE. In a world
dominated by CGI movies, this one is a breath of fresh air (the same
applies to the upcoming film FRANKENWEENIE by Tim Burton). We have
people with different personalities: the weirdo, the show-off bully,
the cheerleader, the not-so-bright jock and the silly geek. Just like
THE BREAKFAST CLUB, but they have to get along in order to survive,
just like in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Also, a book is involved in it.
A book just like in EVIL DEAD. There is a lot of thrills, chills (lots
of them), and laughs (splattered (excuse the pun) here and there).
Family appropriate? Of course! What do you think? A kid would be caught
dead with an R-rated zombie film with over the top gore. It does a
great job spoofing the genre. Give it a watch, I recommend it, it might
prepare your kids into watching classic horror films (of course you
know, viewer discretion is advised). Bottom line: It's good, give it a
watch! Rated PG for scary images and some adult references, that might
go over the heads of children under 13.
