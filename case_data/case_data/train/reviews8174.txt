what did just happen??

McAvoy was brilliant, you have to give him that. He played that twisted
man brilliantly. As for the rest of the movie? What the hell is it
about? The endless fall of a twisted mind? Endless fall of the twisted
society?Saw no point in the movie or in the plot. If the point was to point out
to a humanity in crisis... well, thank you, but we all knew that one
already. Only thing funny, maybe, is to see how the coppers in Scotland
are doing it, only, of course, bloated and exaggerated to the point of
a pure comedy as seen in the beginning of the movie.All in all, I could have wasted my time a bit better.
