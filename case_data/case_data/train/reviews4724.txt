terrible bad story

Just watched it. Acting great.But this is so badly written ---> 1 - HOW did the black girl escape! Her & her friend were drugged all
the time? Oh, she just "managed" to get away -- she's in a locked room!
Drugged! But she "manages" to get away . . . and another oh! her captor
couldn't catch her! But the captor managed to get them the first time
in broad daylight -- which is never explained! 2 - the captor knows one of her captives has escaped yet makes NO
EFFORT to leave, clean up evidence, DO ANYTHING AT ALL, just stays
there.3 - and when girl says in hospital "you were there" Hugh Jackman runs
away to make him look like the suspect; he doesn't bother to tell
anyone - like the cops - I KNOW WHERE SHE'S TALKING ABOUT! LET'S GO
NOW, IT'S THE CRAZY AUNT!4 - why did the aunt not kill them after capture? Why do they need to
stay alive? 5 - guy gets beaten & imprisoned in a cube of pain for a week, yet
can't manage to articulate "my aunt did it." He was coherent enough to
say "They only cried when I left them" to Hugh Jackman when Hugh
Jackman grabs him by the throat in public; but he can't manage "after
my aunt took them away" when Hugh Jackman beats him nearly to death? 6 - cop is angry, goes to his desk, throws things around, by CHANCE
things fall on the floor & he sees a new CRUCIAL clue.It's a movie of bad red herrings, and coincidence. PS. Cop goes into a room of trunks and RUSHES to open one! It's full of
SNAKES! Now if I opened up the first trunk in a room full of trunks and
the first trunk was full of snakes, I don't think I would open all the
other trunks, yet Cop wants to open more!
