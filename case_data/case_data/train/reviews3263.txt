Finally a love story worse than Twilight

I never thought I'd write that, and it pains me to write this about a
Tim Burton movie, but it was just bloody awful. The intro fast-forwards
over events in the 18th century that transform the rich and successful
fish business owner Barnabus Collins into a vampire, and shows us how
he was sealed in a coffin and buried by an angry mob. When he wakes up
about 200 years later, we are introduced to the 1970's Collins family:
A charming bunch of quirky people, from the weird daughter to the
alcoholic psychiatrist.It was set up for comedy to come, but there the fun sadly ended, and
was replaced by endless, brain-numbing dialogs and colorful montages,
followed by a deus ex machina ending.Most jokes are forced and the pacing erratic, but the biggest flaw of
this movie is that it's absolutely impossible to find any kind of
cohesive plot in it. Is it about restoring the family business? No,
wait, maybe it's about the struggle between Barnabus and the witch that
turned him into a vampire. Might be about Barnabus trying to become
human again with the help of some unexplained procedure done by the
alcoholic. No, apparently it's about the love story between two people
we don't even hear talking to each other until 1,25 hours into the
movie, but who 20 minutes later can't live without each other.Honestly, it's so nondescript that I can't even write a coherent review
about it. It's not funny (apart from some scenes you see in the
trailer), it's not dramatic, not scary, not romantic, and the
characters sure aren't going to captivate anyone. I don't know what
it's supposed to be, but the end result is a boring mess; more of a
patch-work of desultory scenes than a movie.
