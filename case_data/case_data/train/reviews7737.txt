Random events, poorly shotdire rubbish, signed by Raimi. Raining blood

I guess 'Evil Dead' means 'The Evil Dead Beings', or 'The Evil Dead
People'a completely random name for an ambition-less movie, directed
and acted by hacks (with Raimi lurking, it seems), sometimes basely
parodying, as if it mattered, with a nonexistent scripta mindless
rollercoaster of random eventsthat starts with a handful of
youngstersfive, I believegetting together to help one of them, a
young woman, called Mia, to get over the first steps of the withdrawal,
the period of fighting addiction. The movie is very disappointing
andugly, displeasing, completely unexciting and trite.The addict woman, Mia, and her brother, come from a familial background
of insanity.From the book found beneath the house in the forest, the youngsters
find out about the reign of evilbut also about the way to rescue its
victims. All events take place during a day (and a storm). The gruesome
is of the spectral, and also of the gory kindspecters and gore.Towards the end, it rains blood, one actress looks goodor, at least,
niceagain (perhaps because her character's once careless brother now
sacrificed himself for her, in an intendedly galvanic moment), the sun
rises, it's over.There is no storylinejust bits of events, random eventsa book,
Italian translations written on its pages ('SONO TUTTI MORTI'), fights
with chainsaws and nail guns, this sort of very general rubbishin the
most classic American template: a house in the forest, a few
youngsters, and high water. This movie is indeed dire rubbish. It
looks, as I have mentioned, really ugly, and clumsily shot, the work of
a bunch of larval minds.A hack, Alvarez, directed this movie, but Raimi still has a hand in it,
which is a shameas a producer, which doesn't make him any honor. (I
have read that Raimi picked this idiot hack to direct the movie.) I
realized I kept forgetting what just happened in the moviewho cut the
third victim's handwhere did they read the prophecy, and who read
itetc., but this was because everything seemed so devoid of interest,
and lifelesstruly dead, and because the whole setup has no meaning
whatsoever: and was not meant to have any; indeed, a very bad movie.The acting is dishearteningly poora highlight would be the teacher
whispering 'evil'.In truth, I felt thrilled for a moment, at the sight of one of the
book's pageshoping it will remind me of 'Seven'which it didn't.The topics are very general, and vaguewitchcraft, a cursed bookthe
hazy Sabbath at the beginningthe obviously threatening witch and her
blurred language.Otherwise, I have seen Evil Dead'in a movie theater where a handful of
morons spoiled the otherwise tasteless enjoyment: a couple were
ceaselessly crunching chips, and presumably having some kind of damn
lunch thereI had brought a bottle of cola, and drank some of it;
others were flashing their phones, from time to time.
