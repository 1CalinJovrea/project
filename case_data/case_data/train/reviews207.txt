I loved all of these women.

Pitch perfect 2 is a hilarious comedy and musical movie with lovely
women.amazing music and fantastic acting. It's been three years since the Barden Bellas (Anna Kendrick, Rebel
Wilson) became the first all-female group to win a national title. All
seems well until a botched Lincoln Center performance for the president
leads to a scandal that strips them of their performing duties, causing
internal tension and strife. With the world championships on the
horizon in Copenhagen, Denmark, the women must get their act together
for their one and only shot at redemption.Lesbians and feminists must see this excellent movie.
