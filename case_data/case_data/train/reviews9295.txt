Not worth the time

This film was god awful. I expected it to be at least a little
entertaining but its not. The trailer for the film pretty much spoils
the entire movie. The acting is the equivalent to a pornography film
and the cinematography is beyond terrible. It's a clich√© cash grab that
is not worth the money to see in theaters or buy on blue-ray. I even
found myself laughing at how bad some of the scenes in this film are,
specifically the ending where the whole thing is predictable. Hell even
in the second act of the film, they introduce these "Candy Bar" girls
who not even kidding try to kill a main character for a candy bar. The
script is lazy and not engaging in any way. The tension completely
drops as you realize the protagonists will always find a convenient way
out of a bad situation. Deus ex Machina. Do not see this film unless
you want to have a laugh with a couple of friends over how bad it is.
It's really not a good movie.
