Fail!

Ugh, this movie was disappointing to me! I was waiting the whole time
for something to really hit me, and nothing did. The Huntsman only
"taught" Snow White one thing. The end was the worst. They never
clarify anything. Who does she end up choosing in the end? It could be
either dude. The Huntsman wasn't wearing fancy clothes at the end and
it looked like he was going to leave, so does that mean she doesn't
choose him? I was so confused at the end and mad that they didn't
finish the plot. Also, the writers held the awkward scenes out too long
and didn't hold important scenes out long enough. The end scene was way
too long. I felt awkward sitting there staring at Snow White being
queen for 20 minutes. Overall, I felt like it had so much potential,
but it failed miserably.
