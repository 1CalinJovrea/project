Surprisingly Hilarious

I liked it, it's not like any other Rom-com i've seen before. It's
obviously not a masterpiece but it does the job, it's entertaining,
funny and different:The characters are not the typical "model-looking"Rom-com clich√©, they
are normal looking and relatable characters. the movie is an
exaggeration (for comedy proposes of course) of quotidian situations,
thoughts, problems etc that happen everyday. People laughed ALL the
time during the movie it's been long since I've seen people laugh so
much.I also discovered my new favorite comedian, the brilliant Amy Schummer.
If you are looking to have a great laugh and a good time this movie is
for you.
