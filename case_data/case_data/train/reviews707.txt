Extremely boring hollow movie

Wasn't expecting much but was dragged by high IMDb review score... was
so wrong here- film is so boring that I started to fast forward in the
middle of it (for 3 minutes as my girlfriend told me to stop as she
watched most of it and it's not much of torment left). Film is done in
a Blair Witch Project way- main characters are filming everything and
it's the same way of personal camera story tell way. As all we know it
tells the story of American teenagers and such teenagers are the only
positive audience this film can have. Actually I am really surprised it
can have any positive audience as I really tried hard to understand
what could be graded so high... Film doesn't show anything- action just
goes flat forward relentless- guys are talking about everything but
nothing they say is really interesting. It tries to show feelings guys
share between each other- their relationship and emotion-play. The
thing is that story is sooo poorly made and scenario is sooo weak that
all the behaviour of the guys (specially Andrew with his psycho
problems) is tiresome and is annoying for the spectator. The only
positive thing is special effects- they are nice but you could good as
well watch them separately- you would save a lot of time... So I will-
as this movie- tell no more- there is nothing more to say...
