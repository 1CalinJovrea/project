Keira Knightly watch out you have been served

This was a really good flick. My wife and I saw the Keira version a
number of years ago and I gotta admit it was fun and gave you an eyeful
of the dilemma women must have had when wealth only passed through
sons. I watched this with my wife, and enjoyed Matt Smiths performance
but the lead actress Lily James carried this movie. I was not quite
sure how on earth this movie was going to play out but in the end it
she just rocked. Keep in mind I really enjoyed keiras performance in
the original non zombie version. One downer in this film is that sadly
this Mr Darcy just did not have the gravitas that several prior MR.
Darcy's have had. Perhaps it was because he was so young looking,
looking more like 22 than the typical 30 plus actors I have seen in the
past that seem more believable when they push back on the elder
aristocracy in scenes, they should have pulled in an actor 5 or 10
years his senior. The movie was just alternate universe great for the
first 2/3 and then as it moved into the final confrontation it veered
more and more from the source material and I think that made it sink to
just solidly entertaining movie. SPOILER sort of, stay through the
first part of the credits folks.......
