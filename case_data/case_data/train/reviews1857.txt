Can't believe the high ratings!

For a movie about trying not to be cliché and cheesy, it was just that.
From the portrayal of the cliché music company exec who says,
"Capiche," to the all white group of alley kids extorting cigarettes
suddenly cooperating to sing background vocals. The daughter, whose
mother says is "Terrible" on guitar suddenly plays like Hendrix?
Please! This movie was cliché after cliché and held no integrity for
its art like it professed in its story. I'm puzzled at how others were
able to offer such high ratings for such a ho-hum effort. Either
insider connections trying to hype their friends' work or hired review
writers. Not sure. Half a star for the story + half a star for the
song.
