Jason bourne vs two face

First of all it is a decent action movie, but that is about it. It
would be even better if they removed the James Bond completely. Why
call it James Bond if you remove the gadgets the cars and the girls.
(prob. to get better sales..)A radio and a personal gun? Budget for Gadgets was only enough to place
4 leds on a fake gun and buy a toy radio? And then re-use an old bond
car? Was there no budget to get a Aston martin one 77? The hacking stuff was boring and full of plot holes, they obvious did
not have a budget for a decent evil lair (that island was fake and the
room with the servers was cheap) so they used the digital terrorist as
an excuse. Moneypenny was boring and way to ugly for a decent bond girl. James being an alcoholic and screwing whores, then gets her killed,
nice plan there who the f is the bad guy? Almost looks like he planned
this, so nobody would find out he screwed a prostitute. They go to some remote place instead of some military base, lets go to
some place where the bad guys can just blow up the entire house and
have a nice bbq after that. Why use Q gadgets if you can make bombs out
of plastic bags and light bulbs. Who needs a Billion dollar budget for
intelligence just use haunting rifles and improvised booby-traps.They at least could film someone walking with a flashlight in the
distance but they obvious said to some one: "You, go there and just go
nuts with the flashlight so it is clear to the viewer. And why would
you walk there with a flashlight? You could put a giant glowing sign on
your head, with: "we are here, please shoot us".At the end he is crying like a little baby about a woman who gave an
order that almost killed him. James Bond died there not M, M is just a
replaceable character.Next time just call it "MI6 the movie" and don't use James Bond.
