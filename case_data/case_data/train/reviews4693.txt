Beautiful

Anyone interested in this film already knows the premise by now if they
have read this far, so I won't rehash it.All I will say is that this film could have easily been contrived and
cheesy and hokey and clich√©d but rather, the end is result is truly one
of the finest, most real representations of youth and love I have seen
in a long time. And the fact that it seemed so genuine is exactly why I
have not cried in a film so much since...."The Perks of Being a
Wallflower." Chloe Grace Moretz has already proved she is a force to be
reckoned with, but by an accomplishment like playing the key character
in a film that was made to be a tearjerker without coming across as
completely laughable shows what a strong actress this young woman truly
is.Excellent, relatable script, wonderful direction and perfectly edited,
the fact the a bunch of tween girls went "Huh? What? That's the end?"
when the credits began to roll proved that R.J. Cutler knew exactly
when to end this film at the precise moment. There was no need to
overstay the welcome.Make sure you have some Kleenex.
