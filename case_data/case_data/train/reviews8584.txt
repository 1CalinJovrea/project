Disturbing on many different levels

I was really looking forward to Clown after seeing the trailer, the
concept seemed pretty original and interesting and I liked what I saw.
If you felt the same way, I would highly recommend that you give this
film a watch. In the end it surpassed my expectations and left me
feeling pretty disturbed. The acting from the leads is solid, Andy Powers especially is fantastic
as Kent and carries the earlier parts of the film with a really good
performance. Laura Allen is also very good as Kent's wife Meg whose
journey through the film is in some ways as interesting to witness as
his own. Some of the supporting cast are admittedly not fantastic, but
that doesn't detract from the movie as a whole. The film is generally well-paced but suffers a little during the middle
where it seems to stall, don't worry if you feel this way because it
soon gets going again and when it does, it really does. Some of the
scenes towards the end will stay with me for a long time. Clown is dark, disturbing, original and striking. One of the best
horror films of recent years.
