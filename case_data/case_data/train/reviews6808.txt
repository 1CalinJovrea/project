Skip seeing the movie and go straight to stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork

Imagine a completely humourless instalment of A Series of Unfortunate
Events in which a young Count Olaf seduces Violet's dim-witted older
cousin and takes her to live in his haunted red paint factory. Throw in
some incest and a lot of graphic violence. Or skip seeing the movie and
go straight to stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork.The plot is one long clich√© - lonely young woman moons over handsome
mysterious stranger, moves to isolated house where terrible secrets of
the past emerge to the accompaniment of loud noises, scary music and
special effects. Much blood is spilled before the heroine and her
rescuer emerge slightly the worse for wear but still alive. The setting was depressing rather than eerily atmospheric. The acting
was stilted and drab, the Edwardian era costuming shiningly synthetic.
The special effects seemed designed primarily to showcase the amount of
money and effort put into them.
