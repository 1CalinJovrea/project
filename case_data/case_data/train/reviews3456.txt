Excellent movie

How this slipped under my radar is bewildering. It was a well-made
story. Character development was very believable and moving. I got
choked up a bit in some scenes. There are a few funny parts too. The CG
was excellent, especially during the "dogfight" scene. The creature
effects were a bit Jim Hensonish (if that's a word LOL), but still
believable too, especially after you realize where they come from. Not
unlike a good Quentin Tarantino film, the story hops around a bit,
present and the past, little background stories of each of the main
characters. Kind of hard to distinguish between the two main characters
in those sequences, since the actors look similar, but you understand
them better as the movie rolls on. And great cliffhanger plot twist at
the end. Don't pay attention to the movie ratings, this is a great sci-
fi movie, watch it, give it a chance. I try to only watch movies with a
rating of 6 out of 10 and above, but this was definitely an exception
and kept me glued to the screen.
