Loved It

People really are too serious these days, Jurrasic World is a fun
exciting thrilling film and a I really enjoyed it a I feel like I've
waited almost all my life for another Jurrasic Park type film to be
realised and I'm so happy they did! All these negative reviews are
actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be
slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can
do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in
the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it. I'm a die hard fan
of the jurrasic parks and maybe because I loved all the other films so
much this was just brilliant it brought me back to my childhood made me
remember why I loved them films so much there so exciting and
entertaining and it makes you feel all the emotions. This is what I
want when I go to see a movie I want to feel the emotions I want to be
excited. I mean I literally haven't stopped talking about this film
since I saw it. I love Jurrasic World, best film in ages.
