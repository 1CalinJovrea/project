Excellent and elegant.

I loved this movie. I know some critics say this movie is like flicking
through a National Geographic magazine. I disagree, this movie is a
well-balanced triumph. Fantastic views, simple yet wonderfully poignant
story line and strong lead actor. Kristen wig and Sean Penn had
unidimensional roles within the movie but they are not the leads. The
humor was tasteful, adequate and well placed. It was such a pleasant
surprise from your day to day blockbuster and I strongly prefer this
movie to the desolation of Smaug which I watched the night before. Ben
Stiller has managed to achieve an impossible feat with this movie, an
elegant contemporary film without excessive emotional histrionics or
sexual overtones. Strongly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a
modern take on life. Just like the lead, Walter Mitty is your everyday
guy doing an everyday job faced with realistic modern day issues. One
day, he takes a leap of faith and that has made all the difference. How
can anyone not love this movie?
