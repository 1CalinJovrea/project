The way things were

The Homesman, written and directed and starring Tommy Lee Jones tells
the story of Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) a spinster who takes on the
responsibility of bringing three insane women to Iowa where they can be
taken care of.She saves or spares the life of George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) and
enlists him on her arduous five week journey.When you see Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones, you know the acting is
going to be stellar. The parts of the insane women, Arabella Sours
(Grace Gummer), Theoline Belknapp (Miranda Otto), Gro Svendsen (Sonja
Richter) because of the great directing remained the focus while being
secondary characters. The movie had a Shakespearean feel to it and that
is a great compliment. These ladies portrayed insanity, believably and
that takes serious dedication and acting ability."The Homesman" was a tragedy and because of it, some people might not
be able to pallet the story; there were some shocking attention
grabbing scenes that the average viewer might not be prepared for.
Those scenes, to me, were great examples of a different time, a time
when life was hard and people died.The Homesman is a story that sits with you and makes you thankful for
many things, even if it just the shoes on your feet.
