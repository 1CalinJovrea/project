About as Generic as a Boxing Movie could be!

This will be short, Southpaw is about as straightforward as you would
expect from a boxing movie. A once great fighter falls into despair
only to be given another chance at redemption in some sort of title
fight. This movie hit just about every single plot point you would
expect it to. And that's what makes Southpaw feel so dull and
unengaging, it holds too few surprises. He gets beaten down again and
again only to find redemption later in the movie just as expected. This
is the type of movie where if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the
movie, period!But to no surprise, however, Jake Gyllenhaal is the saving grace of the
movie (the 5/10 score would certainly be lower if he had not been in
this movie). He is physically committed (looks like a complete beast),
but is also able to bring the necessary emotional state the character
required. If he had not been in the movie, this would have been a
complete disaster. He totally fit the role of the down on his luck
boxer, but more importantly hit the role of the damaged father even
better. And even though we know exactly what is coming to our 'hero',
the performance by Gyllenhaal makes it seem a tad more enjoyable.At the end of the day, you've seen a ton of movies like Southpaw. You
could probably predict the ending of the story based on the trailers
alone. Even though Jake Gyllenhaal gives it his all, the movie can't
help but fail because of the extremely generic script.Instead, go watch The Wrestler again!
