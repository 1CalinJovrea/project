Its an uninspired and non-surprising moving. It's like Tom Ford thought
"hey, let's make something with art" and used all tools he could find
in his lunchbox. The end is non-surprising, the story between is
non-surprising and it has logical deficits. Why does the sheriff not
look at Tony, when he is searching for the killer of his wife and
daughter? Why did Tony talk and talk and talk, but didn't shoot the
killer in the first moment - haven't he seen in movies, what happens if
I talk and talk to the killer? The only interesting character in the
complete movie is the sheriff. The start of the movie - old naked
dancing woman - is awful. If you have the impulse to run out the cinema
- it is the right moment. This movie is a waste of lifetime.
