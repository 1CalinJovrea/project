Excellent movie

Its an excellence movie. I enjoyed watching the movie along with my
14yrs. Its thrilling throughout the length. The graphics are superb.
Nice plot. The movie kept on the seat edge from beginning to ending.
Matt and Pedro did great job. Nice and witty. Most of the characters
are Chinese.
