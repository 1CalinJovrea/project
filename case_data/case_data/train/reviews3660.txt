I wanted my money back

With all the hype for this movie and some really good actors (Ian
McShane, Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Bob Hoskins) it was a let
down. The writers didn't give Stewart enough lines and lines they did
give her were horrid. That speech? That was suppose to motivate people?
What the hell? The girl didn't smile at all. And yes I know the movie
was set in a dark time, and there is no happiness in the land. But she
didn't smile when she was brought back to life nor at the end.Let's talk about the ending. The line Stewart has, "You cannot have my
heart." That was it? Really? That's the big ending that you have? You
have got to be kidding me. That in no shape or form should have been
the last line of the movie.And the love triangle that they still left in tack at the end, it's not
that much of a triangle. She doesn't appear interested in either of
them. The two men are in love with her, and only one is true love. But
you would have no idea that is the case, because there is no sign of
emotion on her part.Don't pay to see this movie. Anyone who tells you that Stewart was
amazing in this movie, has a very odd definition of, "amazing." She had
about 15-20 lines, not including the speech. There wasn't much acting
required on her part and it's so blatantly obvious that it seems
intentional.
