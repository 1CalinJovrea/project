It's alright.

This is not an entirely awful movie. I do think they could have done
more with what the premise was supposed to be. There were about 5,
maybe 6 times that I jumped in the movie, but it wasn't from the
climax, at all... It was a tad bit gimmicky at times and when the
actors were supposed to be "frightened" and "scared", they weren't good
actors at all. All the other moments of the cast "acting" in between
were alright though. They could've done a lot more than what they did,
and made it a ton more scarier than what it was. I was disappointed
with the ending as well. I loved the plot of the movie and what I thought it was going to be,
but ultimately I was let down. I did enjoy going through the different haunted houses with the cast,
but that was about all I enjoyed out of this movie. If you like haunted
houses, and don't mind cheesy acting here and there, give this movie a
go. If you're looking for something entirely inventive and scary, this
movie is not that. If you go into watching this movie with low expectations, you'll
probably be more satisfied than me.
