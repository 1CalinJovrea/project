Edge of your seat thriller

Unlocked stars Noomie Rapace, Orlando Bloom, John Malkovich, Michael
Douglas and Toni Collette. Evey one of them played an interesting
character with some great performances, especially Ms Rapace and Mr
Malkovic.It didn't get very good reviews in the UK press and I don't know why.
It starts out as your typical CIA thriller but gets all twisty and
turny with intricate plot type stuff (which actually makes sense and
doesn't have many plot holes or really stupid antagonists) and masses
of action. It was nicely scripted too with some brutal looking violence
that kept you on the edge of your seat for most of the film.
