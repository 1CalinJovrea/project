Affleck the Loser

The Plot.Boston, 1926. The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his
mark on the world. Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground
distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain,
has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now
having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay
of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills,
and notoriety of being an outlaw. But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when
ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns,
battle for control, no one-neither family nor friend, enemy nor
lover-can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most
likely for men like Joe: an early death. Too bad Afleck is the worst actor on the planet.And a poor director.And he can't write.The movie sucks.
