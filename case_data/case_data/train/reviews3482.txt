Cheap mans battle royale

One of the worst movies i've seen this year. The story is just
ridiculous and the acting horrendous.A bunch of employees go to work on a normal day, only things take a
turn for the worse and the soon find out the whole building is on shut
down, and they have to kill each other to survive. The company has put
microchips in all the employees, and use them to explode the people
when they don't follow instructions ( sound familiar)The plot is really bad and the so called twist at the end is even
worse. Its so predictable what's going to happen, and eventually they
all die except the good guy, who happens to plant the explosives on all
the culprits at the end and blow them all up. How would the explosive
still work if it had already been detonated before???? how didn't they
see this on the cameras, they were quite obviously dissecting people's
heads getting these things out, didn't they wonder what was going on?It was really bad, don't waste your time on this movie, its not worth
the time watching it.
