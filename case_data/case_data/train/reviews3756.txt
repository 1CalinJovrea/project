very good film, immersive, fun and interesting watch

let me first say. maybe i am biased because every other review is
pretty negative about this film and rating's also low and because of
that i had really low expectations. on the other hand, i watched this
film because i know that Dadario plays in good films(except Baywatch,
everyone can be excused once i guess) so i expected this film to be
also goodbut i did really liked this movie. no one dragged me to watch it, i
watched it on my own free will, for the reasons mentioned above and i
enjoyed every moment of it. i emphasized every moment because it
immerses you in itself quite well and you don't find any time to get
bored. that is becoming more difficult in todays attention deficit
world and not many films achieve it anymore, even ones with big namesalso its fair to say that i didn't expect film to be super funny or
comedic, so that was not an issue when not every scene tried to have
comedic effect, although i think too much of them still did. usually i
enjoy as much realism as you can put in the movie without loosing
amusement. realism is very important, thats why i like GOT even though
its fantasy, it has more realism than most of dramas these days. so
this movie has lot of realism too, i believed in the journey that
characters took throughout the movie. problems that they had were very
real and relatable. how they approached them were very real, something
like this can totally happen in real life. so in the end one can really
see that writers did their jobs on this onei cant really criticize this film that much, probably there were some
flaws but i didn't notice them. only thing i can say is that some
scenes were a bit exaggerated but thats not much of a criticism. so go
see this movie, i recommend
