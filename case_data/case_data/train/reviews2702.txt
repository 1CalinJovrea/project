Pleasantly surprised.

It has been a long time since I wrote a review but this movie deserves
my time and attention. I definitely did not expect this movie to touch
me in the way that it did.The Pros:- -It is so well edited that I had to recheck the run time of
the movie when it ended. Two hours flew past like the wind.-The acting is great.-The plot will reel you in and never let go. This is simple story
telling at it's best.-The dialogue will never feel boring and the prison scenes are shot in
a way that will leave you in awe.-The score is one of the best I've heard in recent memory. Reminds me
of Sicario, another great film. Some people said it could have been
better but I disagree. The score had me wishing I can write music that
good for movies. It had a certain twist to it, sounds of flutes or
sounds of Arabian music undertones.- The directing? All hail Ric Roman Waugh. I'm going to search for some
of his other movies. If half are as half as good as half of this film,
I might pass out with glee.The Cons: There are non I can think of. I wrote this review a few days
after seeing the film so that I can write a honest review absent
attachment to the film.Go see it.
