Well well well...

An insight into the life of young girl and her friends as they live day
to day under the watchful eye of their young, care free struggling
mother, with occasional help from the hotel manager.At least that is what I think the plot is meant to be. After watching
it at an advanced preview screening, I'm still not sure what to make of
this movie. My friend and I managed to last 30 minutes before walking
out, however we stuck at it more than most people. You can see why it's
critically acclaimed, the acting was well done, however the plot was
water thin at best. However I'd rather watch it over Enders Game or Hot Tub Time Machine 2
any day of the week. Now those are two awful movies*disclaimer* I know I said there would be spoilers, but that's a lie,
that implies that something happened in this movie to spoil!
