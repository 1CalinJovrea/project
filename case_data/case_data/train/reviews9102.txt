Who paid for this?

Really? The Lucky One? I'm the one who's lucky to have a fast forward
button. Lame. Its one of those "I'm dancing in the water and the sun is in my
hair and oooooh I look so happy while lovely music plays in the
background, I'm so carefree and joyful". Vomit.A film made completely of "romantic" montages. Another film that has
basically no storyline, or a storyline so flat they try to jazz it up
with background music and hope that people won't notice. Boring, boring, boring. Oh how convenient for you that you knew the road to walk to her house,
how convenient you get a job there, how convenient she's wearing hot
pants.Dull with a capital D.
