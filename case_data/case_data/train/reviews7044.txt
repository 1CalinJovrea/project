Have FUN

KABLAM, A 10/10 Pretty much one of the best movies out this year.I'm sorry, but anybody who didn't enjoy this movie because of its
shamelessly cheesy storyline and acting is a gigantic tool-bag and
that's all there is to it. I have absolutely no clue WHY people were
expecting the next God Father, or Citizen Kane from a movie where giant
monsters show up and the first thing the military does is build EQUALLY
GIANT ROBOTS to punch them in the face. Cut that out, folks. Don't go
into the movie WANTING to hate it. Give it a chance and enjoy the
colorful and zany adventure.JACKSON BROWNE OUT
