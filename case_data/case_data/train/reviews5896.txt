No More Mr. Nice Guy !

I've been a fan of Jackie Chan since I was a kid. I grew up watching
movies like Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour, First Strike. So I was
excited to see him back in action and he proves he is one of the best
Acton stars ever. The Foreigner provides on plenty of action, suspense, thrills and a
surprisingly fair amount of drama. You may be used to his movies of the
past that are light hearted and fun. This was not your typical Jackie
Film, as it is quite serious with little to no humor and more like his
films "Crime Story" & "New Police Story" which also differ from
Jackie's usual style of action films. Both Jackie & Pierce were both
solid in their roles and the acting was quite good with the characters
being allowed to develop along with the story. It may seem like a
typical revenge, Taken style action movie, but as the film progressed
it turns more into a story involving political intrigue and conspiracy
which I thought at times slowed the movie, but still was entertained
and thrilled throughout.Overall, if your an old school Jackie Chan fan and love his films like
I do, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. One of the best action movies of 2017.7/10
