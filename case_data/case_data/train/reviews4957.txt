Bond on a budget starring the old folks home

There are so many things wrong with this movie. Most of the elements of
a good Bond movie aren't there.The locations aren't well used. The Istanbul roof top & Bazaar chase
has already been shown in "Taken 2" and the TV show "Missing". Dejavu.
The way they showed 'Shanghai' and 'Macau' at night it could have been
filmed anywhere. The Scottish countryside shown was so grim.Where are the cars and gadgets? Nothing but the old Aston Martin. Just
that pistol and tracker. The new Q is so ineffective. The villain played by Javier Bardem. He is more comical than sinister.
With the blond fright wig, the campy overtures and the most frightening
of all, the dentures this must the most absurd bad guy in Bond history.The climax feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of
money for the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run
down Scottish house. With the home made defences and geriatric
defenders, it felt like Home Alone meets the Golden Girls. Might as
well have asked Betty White or grandma to join in. The new Bond girl Berenice Marlohe is exotic and fascinating to look
at. But why only one? Writing her out of the show so early and not
having another was a mistake. The Bond girl is supposed to end up saved
by Bond with a hook up at the end. Unless you consider M a Bond girl.The focus of the movie is M. Judi Dench was always too provincial
looking for MI6. The only good thing about this movie is that Ralph
Fiennes is replacing her. Finally. There was no need to dedicate a
whole movie to her farewell. Daniel Craig is just so haggard he looks worse than the villain. It's
time to replace him with someone younger and handsomer. Baffled by the
good reviews. Be warned we are being short changed.
