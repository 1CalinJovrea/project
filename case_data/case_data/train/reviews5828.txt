From the standpoint of a dispassionate observer separate from the
tangled mess that is US politics. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The intensity of the movie is
unrivaled. The genius who designed the plot of this movie deserves a
whole host of accolades for them personally. Twists and turns around every corner making it engaging on a level
similar to that experienced when deconstructing a Shakespeare play.
This movie is for anyone who desires not only a piece of quality
entertainment but also something that stretches their intellect. Aside
perhaps from the role of Tony Stark I have never encountered a more
badass main character.
