The Worst of the Left Agenda

The Plot.A couple are driving home when their car breaks down just as the Purge
commences. Meanwhile, a police sergeant goes out into the streets to get revenge
on the man who killed his son, and a mother and daughter run from their
home after assailants destroy it. The five people meet up as they attempt to survive the night in Los
Angeles. Surprisingly good low budget flick not so much a horror film as it is
like The Running Man in a sense.The tension is more or less consistent and the story moves relatively
quickly.But in the last third it takes a turn. And it essentially becomes a
left wing propaganda movie where the white one percenters use their
wealth to kill the underclasses. BOR-RING. You ruined the movie with your dumb agenda. We need to rally
and fight against this subversive junk. Down with the non-inclusive one sided left agenda.
