Biggest disappointment of 2012,

It speaks poorly of today's moviegoers that anyone would rate this
turkey higher than 3. The continuity, photography, lighting, and
direction are atrocious. The story makes no sense; and the screen is
too dark to see much of anything 20% of the time.I like Mark Walberg, and I just love Kate Beckensale; but I challenge
anyone to tell us what she was wearing in ANY of her many scenes. The
photography was so bad, and the choppy camera-hop was like an ADD kid
was running things.This one played and died quickly in theaters, so we caught it on DVD.
It cost us $1.60 for the rental' 80 cents each. This movie is not worth
80 cents.
