Don't waste your hard earned money on this movie

Sean Penn is too old to play these roles and very unsuitable. The love
interest was only used to show her skin, not much of an actress, how
she got cast in the movie is baffling. They both looked terrible and
the plot was barely able to hold the movie. Two men fighting over a
woman, lots of sex and clothes coming off. Sean Penn thought making
another 80s clich√© movie would make comeback, he was clearly wrong. All
in all an awful movie, awful cast, awful acting. Very deserving of the
Razzie award. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. How it ever
hit the screens is perplexing. The only good acting was by Javier
Bardem which shows that only he was able to bring some flavour to it
but then his role is minimal.
