Was expecting a chick flick

Well I was expecting a chick flick, but this is not your ordinary one
at that, yes there are a lot of moments where this is very sweet,
romantic and with the main lead without his shirt on, but it also has
warmth, depth, a different plot and just a new thing about it that
other chick flicks doesn't.Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum is a good movie couple, and even
though the film is more about them not knowing or fitting together,
they do and that makes this film good and of course sweet, romantic and
chick flick material :)I actually was very entertained and even though this is not your
typical sweet story, couple falls in love and live happily ever after,
based on a real story kind of flick. It does have some qualities and
punch lines that just work.
