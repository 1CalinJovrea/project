Storyline as thin as the air in space.

*Spoiler alert* So it all starts pretty OK on a space station that is
about to receive some earth samples from Mars. We get to meet the crew
and some of them are top cast as Ryan Renolds and Jake Gyllenhal. And
off course it strikes me that at least one of these are the main
character. But that thought passed as soon as Ryan Renolds dies after
only 10 minutes in the most stupid way. So the movie starts, I'm
awfully confused of who the main characters are, what kind of team they
are. Who should I like? Why is Jake Gyllenhal so quiet? Why is the
biologist so naive and the questions go on forever. The story line is
as thin as the air in space and as simple as a one cell organism.
Basically you are watching a indestructible starfish kill one by one in
a gory way until everybody is dead. The end is so unoriginal that a 5
year old could make something better.
