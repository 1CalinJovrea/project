Sparks only a little (at best)

I haven't read the source novel, but I also hadn't read the "Notebook"
either. And I really think the latter is one of the best romantic
movies that are out there. Considering the novel at hand here (the
source so to speak) comes from the same man as the Notebook, you'd be
forgiven to expect something similar.While I think Zac Efron might be underrated by many as an actor
(although he still has to prove himself), he doesn't help his case in
this one. Puppy eyes and a character that is thinner than a piece of
paper do not bode him well. Although according to the female fans
attending at the cinema, they wouldn't want him any other way. Which
brings me to the one point this movie really excels. It's the reactions
you get from the crowd. Believe me, if you didn't watch it at a cinema
you lost quite an experience! It was a hoot. I wouldn't be surprised if
they got the title wrong and refer to the female lead as the "Lucky
One". Just saying.Apart from those hilarious moments, most of this is longing looks,
desires held back and other stuff, that will either "excite" you or
leave you cold. Predictable and boring to the point, where even a
sudden change of character (why?) towards the end of the movie does not
help at all
