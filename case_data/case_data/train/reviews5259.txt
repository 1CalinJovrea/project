This movie was a waste of time

After watching this movie, one has to ask oneself WHY???? The only
thing good about it was the credits at the end letting you know that it
was finally over, you kept waiting for it to get better, but sadly it
never did, in fact it got worse as it progressed.The endless attempts at intellectual conversation in this movie were
not at all entertaining, in fact, they only served one purpose, that
was to fill the almost two hours of time wasted. The bottom line is
this... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, even the wives hated it!!! Wish I would
have read the reviews before renting it.It reaffirms my beliefs that Hollywood is disconnected from the real
world.
