All Lives Are Worth Protecting

The protection business is booming. Corruption has pushed the demand
for professional armor-guarding above the roof. Wealth is a mountain
climbed with slimy, profiteering hands. Micheal does not think too much
about his clients' ascents, all he is concerned with are the enemies
they have collected on their rise to the top.Micheal's operation gathers scenarios. He prides himself on foreseeing
the unforeseeable. He has rose to his AAA status by being as fickle as
the scumbags he chaperons. Saving lives is the business model, but one
cannot help but to wonder if this is a misuse of resources.Darius is Micheal's worst nightmare. An assassin that does not
subscribe to any logistical course plans, Darius is the intangible
crack in Micheal's security. They are at odds without being enemies.
Neither has respect for the other, but they both walk with a subdued
fear of one another. Well maybe just Micheal does.As even the least astute viewer could predict, the two fill the roles
of yin and yang in unashamed cookie cutter ways. Conveniently
paralleled backstories pull the unlikely duo into a phony symbiosis,
and the breaks in character flow from this light bromance.â€‹What is a nobler calling: Saving the lives of pampered villains, or
killing them? Neither is righteous, but the origins of these careers
hold some promise. Taking up very little screen time are hints of these
heroes' calls to adventure, but clearly monetary fulfillment robbed
their sympathies along the way.
