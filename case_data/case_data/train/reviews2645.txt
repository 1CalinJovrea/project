Little Aussie Sci Fi Gem

Science Fiction Volume One: The Osiris Child is a little Aussie science
fiction gem. This is not a big budget film but it makes the best possible use of the
funding it does have. For its money it offers up excellent performances
from the predominantly Australian cast, above average special effects
and an interesting story that takes a bookish approach, with the film
broken down into chapters. Each chapter has its own overriding theme
that builds into a bigger story of interplanetary imperialism, greed,
political intrigue and friendship. Perhaps the only downside to this tale being the creature effects,
which seemed a bit "muppety" at times and were a long way from being
genuinely scary.That said, this film remains a polished affair in most respects and
puts the often lazy efforts of big budget counterparts to shame. Eight
out of ten from me.
