This is horrible

I started watching this hoping it will be something scary with ghosts,
but it ended up being a very bad movie with terrible acting and a bad
script.This is more like a zombie movie, not scary at all just plain
stupid and disgusting.When the brother becomes possessed it's just
bad.You don't even get to see how he kills the mother, you can imagine
it.The daughter, Bella Thorne is just a bad actress.It all seems so
forced.I wanted to stop the movie since the beginning but I said I
should give it a chance.What a waste of time! I don t recommend!
