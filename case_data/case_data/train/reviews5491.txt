Too much

What we have in V/H/S are a bunch of prolonged horror moments that in 

usual cases would be the climax to any average horror movie. The movie 

manages to throw 5 of these 'money shots' at the viewer without the 

need to tell any real story, build any of the characters or introduce 

their personality's to the audience. Whether this is a stroke of genius 

originality or just laziness is the question.



You'd be forgiven for thinking that V/H/S is the result a brain 

storming session where five writers pitched five stories, with one 

'Eureka' moment of making a movie of the ending of all five. What they 

seemingly failed to spend any real time on though was the glue to bind 

the five stories together. It is completely irrelevant, in fact I would 

go as far as to say the movie would be better without it, a "Here are 

five tapes that were found, now watch them" instead.



I have to say I am a fan of 'found footage movies'. To me they achieve 

the desired effect and can, at times, create some truly chilling 

moments. This movie does have it's moments but after a while it all 

gets too much, the 'found footage' angle is somehow lost with the 

constant change of story. You are never really allowed to reach the 

same level of suspense as with other films in this genre.



6/10. It passed the time but I eventually found myself wanting it to 

end and asking myself "How many stories to go?"
