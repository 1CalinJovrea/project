Cast continuity is the gimmick

The tracking of these characters over a 12 year period is interesting
and impressive, but the movie has gaping plot holes and character
development that is either unexplained or unbelievable. Some of the
characters are just caricatures kind of thrown up on the wall with no
support or explanation. The actors who play the two leads, Ellar
Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater, are one-dimensional actors in this
movie and play very morose, seemingly depressed youth who drag
themselves through life - they certainly don't demonstrate any joy for
living. You can understand why Mason's high school girlfriend breaks up
with him. Mom's two husbands go haywire with no development or warning,
and this is especially jarring in the transformation of the second
husband, who goes from being a very cool guy who is an understanding
stepfather and husband to being someone's idea of a vet who goes bad.
And how could Dad go from being a flaming liberal to finding happiness
with the stereotyped bible-thumping, gun-toting Republican Texas
family? In the end, the continuity of the actors is the thing, but the
acting and plot development disappoints and leaves one feeling empty at
the end.
