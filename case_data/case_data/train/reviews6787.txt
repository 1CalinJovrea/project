Boring and Ruined

Once upon a time Tim Burton was different & I loved his work.But I
think I may have fallen out of love with him, over this.The film has
ruined the whole feel and character of the books. Burton even changed
the powers of the central character, Emma. Why would you do that? Eva
Green doesn't help by giving the worst performance of her career. The
first hour of the film is so dull, and when the film finally starts to
move, the story has been totally rewritten.The Harry Potter films were fairly true to the books, because they
wanted the films to appeal to the same audience. What was Tim Burton
aiming for? To alienate the book fans?If you enjoyed the Peregrine books, keep away from this it's a big
disappointment. Awful film.
