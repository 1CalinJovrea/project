A Great Film that I highly recommend if you are an adult

If you are an adult wanting to see a great film about real life family
issues with some terrific court room drama you should see this film. It
is well written and directed with great performances by Downey and
Duvall. I think Downey gives his best performance in a film and Duvall
is again outstanding. I found this to be a better film than Gone Girl. It is more believable
and more moving.I am a baby boomer who likes science fiction but I am quite pleased to
see a film without a super hero and CG images. I hope to convince my daughters (all in their 20's) and my parents (in
their 80's) to see this movie.
