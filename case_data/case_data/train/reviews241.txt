A good entry in the series, but not a terrific movie

Ice Age: Continental Drift is the fourth installment in the Ice Age
series, which was started a decade ago by FOX when they tried their
hand at animation again after Titan A.E. became a box office bomb. The
series follows a group of quite different prehistoric animals and the
plot that it follows has been so far a formulaic "go from point A to B"
story.As the title suggests, Ice Age 4's plot revolves around the separation
of continents. The herd is separated and while the original trio goes
into an adventure overseas, the "half opossum, half mammoth" family
tries to reach a rock bridge to meet up there. The film's animation is
fantastic (you could hardly say a mainstream animated movie doesn't
have terrific CGI) and backgrounds and water effects are beautiful, but
the movie's storytelling is too fast paced and there are too many
characters for them to develop while the movie lasts.If the series is too formulaic what is the appeal of this movie? For
anyone who has seen the whole series, you'll be happy to know Diego
meets a female saber-tooth on the way and Sid is reunited with his
sloth family. Amongst the new characters are a crew of pirates that
capture the trio while they explore the ocean and become the main
antagonists of the film.The movie is overall quite worth it to watch with your family, but even
the third one (which I didn't like a lot) had a better paced
storytelling. New characters, in my opinion, don't really display a lot
of personality traits other than Granny Sloth, but it is quite the
enjoyable flick I would watch a few times on theaters.The 3D, by the way, is not really worth it and the movie doesn't make
use of it correctly. There were some moments when the background looked
it was over the characters and that almost gave me a head ache. If
you're taking your family to watch the movie don't waste your money on
3D.
