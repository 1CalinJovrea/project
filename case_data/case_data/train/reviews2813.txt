Exactly As You Expect

Anyone who was expecting a great film going into this one is a complete
tool. This is not a great piece of art, but it is funny. I was a big
fan of Sandler movies in the 90s and lost all interest in the 2000s.
Have not watched any of his movies since Little Nicky, but I thought
"what the hell?" and gave Ridiculous Six a look. Not the greatest thing
I've ever seen but was not expecting it to be. I can honestly say I
enjoyed this movie. For all those reviewers who are skewering it for
being stupid, don't think too hard. It's a farce and farces are
generally farcical. So if you are looking for a couple of laughs and
are not looking for Lawrence of Arabia, The Ridiculous Six is worth a
viewing. Did I love it? No. Was it a brilliant masterpiece of American
cinema? No. Will I watch it again? Maybe. It was certainly more
entertaining than 90% of the crap you troglodytes lap up at the box
office.
