A Good, Clean, Wholesome Entertainment

Sometimes you go to the theater, and you cringe at some of the
previews, most of which are full of sex, violence, and an apocalyptic
view of the world. It's hard to find a movie that is respectable and
clean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults.
"The Intern" is such a movie. Robert DeNiro is superb. How a guy who played such ruthless characters
in "Goodfellas" and "Taxi Driver" can pull off this avuncular gentlemen
is a testament to his craft. His Ben Whittaker almost seems too
perfect, but DeNiro brings a humanity that makes him eminently
believable. Anne Hathaway does a fine turn as the Internet
entrepreneur, and fleshes out well what could have been a cartoon
character of the Ãœbermom. The supporting cast supports wonderfully,
giving the stars plenty of room to shine, not distracting from the
story. And the plot never goes where it shouldn't, something that does
happen in other, more cynical films. So I would very highly recommend this film. It has some "legs," as
evidenced by the fairly sizable audience given that it's in its sixth
week of release. You know why? You'll leave the theater entertained and
uplifted. And how often can you say that at the cinema these days?
