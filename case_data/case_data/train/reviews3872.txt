critics wrong again

after seeing this could not believe the reviews, the film was bad, bad
and bad. the kid playing mowgli has to be the worst child actor i have
ever seen, terrible voice, one gormless expression throughout the film,
he could not convey joy, sadness or fear. the film looked fuzzy and
washed out all the way through. all the voices were flat and un
emotional, great actors as bill murray and christopher walken sounded
like they were on valium. not a patch on the animated version or the
korda version and not remotely close to Disney's own previous live
action retelling of the story that stephen somers directed with an
older mowgli brilliantly played by jason scott lee. the film had no
depth, emotion or character to it. the script was cliché after cliché.
there was no life in any part of it, no pace just seemed to go through
tired set ups. as for it having an ecological message, we could not see
or find it anyway or anytime during the film.
