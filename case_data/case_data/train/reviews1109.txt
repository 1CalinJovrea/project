I Am The Only One Who Was Not Disappointed

Having read the book, and being very impressed, I was looking forward
to the movie interpretation. I was not the least bit disappointed. I
was hoping this movie would not be an overacted, overproduced and sappy
version of the original, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story
played out without the overblown extraneous embellishment that
Hollywood seems to depend on so often.It was great to see how the screenplay added extra material that was
not in the book, and it enhanced the story to make it even better. The
characters were interpreted with full respect to the intention of the
author, Andy Weir, and nothing was overdone. The pacing and editing of
this movie was some of the best I've seen, in fact, some of the
one-liners from the book are done so quickly it pushed the story
forward relentlessly. One thing that struck me is that everyone seemed to be enjoying
themselves, and I think that could be a testament to the originality
and uniqueness of the book. I believe anyone who reads the book is
captivated and involved with the story from beginning to end, and it's
possible this comes across in all phases of the production; the acting,
the sets, sound, everything. They all knew they had some great material
to work with and ran with it.
