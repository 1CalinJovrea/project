It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of
certain movies. Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi,
etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background
stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who
gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren't
present here.Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no
character development, no needless character or background, no
misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing
of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In
fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added.
But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver.
While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying
to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying
beginning and ending.And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you
are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave
the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem
Dafoe.If you're tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John
Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.
