Where is this going?

I'm confused. Christian-like guy turns to a drug delivery job to take
care of himself / family. He has rage issues, dominates and controls
his wife by sheer size yet they are deeply in love. He has bad luck on
a job, gets arrested all while demonstrating he's really not a 'bad
guy' but then he turns into a numb, killing machine because he needs to
save his wife and unborn daughter. I watched this movie because it had
good reviews but now I don't understand why. It reminded me a little of
Tarantino movies like Reservoir Dogs or Django, but those movies had
clear plots, clear direction and climax. Once Vaughn gets his wife
rescued I found myself thinking, now what? This movie was gory, seemed
like it was going somewhere but it ended and I just felt confusion as
to what the point was.
