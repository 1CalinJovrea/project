Parody of an Action Film

I read somewhere that someone reviewed this title and referred to it as
"Die Hard in a mall". This is way off in my opinion. If it is to be
compared to any movie I would go with "Home Alone", such is the puerile
and paper-thin plot.Despite fairly good acting on behalf of the leads, Banderas and
Kingsley, the script just fails to deliver, and in an effort, it seems
to compensate, the director pulls out every cinematic clich√© he could
muster from his film school playbook.Watching this film, you cannot help but think that at any second you
will hear the director yell "Cut" and we will have realized that it was
all just a parody of an action film that is pretend being shot as part
of the real movie which now is about to begin.The story is all too familiar, the action scenes are sub par, and save
for the two big stars the acting is poor. Save your time re-watch Die
Hard or Home Alone... you're welcome.
