On the road to nowhere

For the record, I'm a big Kerouac fan. However, I don't think On the
Road was his best work. I like his later, more introspective writing,
but I know I'm in the minority here. There's a good reason why we had
to wait so long for a screen version of On the Road. Impossible as it
may be to believe, some novels are not written with potential movie
rights in mind. On the Road is a sometimes rambling, stream of
consciousness, string of vignettes without a clear goal in mind. It is
a novel about hedonistic-death-driving on America's highways in a quest
for life and a run from it. For the members of Kerouac's (Sal
Paradise's) group, life is controlled self-destruction because death is
preferable to boredom. These attitudes spring from the times in which
the reality of potential nuclear disaster hung over the nation and the
attitudes so induced found expression in youth who turned the
directionlessness of life into life for the moment.Making a film on such a book requires selection. Kerouac's hedonistic
rampage across America, as selected by director Walter Salles, looks
more mindless and sex-spiced than it did in the novel. Kerouac, as we
see in his later works, was a hedonist with a conscience; a deadly
combination which likely led to him drinking himself to death. Director
Salles sees what he wants to see, a sex-crazed, drug-crazed,
two-dimensional man. If this was truly the man represented in the
novel, the novel would not have had the enduring quality that has made
it literature.I liked the way the 1950s was captured in the film. It was as close to
perfection as you could get. The importance of jazz with its
improvisation mirrors the lives of the travelers. The acting is good
but the interaction is not. Maybe that was the point. There is no need
for interaction in an age when the highest morality was based on
selfishness. The movie may be okay to watch once, but I would prefer
not to go down this road again.
