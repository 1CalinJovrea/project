All-time favorite musical comedy, non-stop replaying.

I love this one just as much as the first one, although I watched PP2
before I could get a chance to watch PP1 first, I still love the humors
and the performances in PP2. No to mention, I bought the Pitch Perfect
BluRay from store just so that I'm not behind with the Pitches while
PP2 is still promoting, therefore I got a free ticket from Fandango to
go watch PP2, again, and I can't believe that I laughed just as much as
the first time!*Off topic* I can't get over how adorable Anna Kendrick and Brittany
Snow is, whether on screen as Beca and Chloe, or off screen as Dork and
Princess, they are just too lovely :)
