People are missing the point

It's a shame that people seem to be missing the point behind this film.
However, on one's first sitting, it's easily done - Refn's style and
pace may fool you into thinking this is a dull, slow film. The long,
seemingly unending shots of actors staring into the distance may make
you question Mat Newman's (the editor) talent. But what you really need
to do is to look deeper into the film, because behind the extreme
violence, the beautiful cinematography & production design and
questionable reality, there is an interesting message. That message
really depends on how you interpret the film, and differentiates from
person to person.For instance, Vithaya Pansringarm's character can be perceived in a
variety of ways - a silent angel out to balance the injustices of his
city, a delusional man who thinks of himself as God, or a vengeful cop
who is simply out to do his job. Ryan Gosling's Julian can be seen as a
confused soul who is out to avenge someone he clearly despised, someone
who is bullied into action by his persuasive mother. Kristen Scott
Thomas's excellent portrayal of Crystal, Julian's thoroughly unpleasant
mother, acts as a wedge between the two of them. And the motives of
each of these characters are questionable throughout.It's certain that Refn's ninth feature film is not a simple crime drama
as you might have expected. Its twists and turns will almost certainly
surprise you, and it will linger on your mind long after the credits
roll. It makes you question what was real and what was not in a way
I've never seen in cinema before. And it really is a shame that a lot
of people seem to completely miss the brilliance and genius behind it.
