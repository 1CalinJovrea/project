The Mona Lisa of Films

I...I don't even know where to begin. It's been 5 days since I watched
the Emoji movie and I still can't get it out of my head. Never in my
life would I have thought that a movie of such exquisite beauty could
EVER exist. But here it is, and it has exceeded all expectations. Tony
Leondis has hereby proved to be the first homo universalis of the 21st
century, and should, in my humble opinion, be honored with the Nobel
Peace Prize of 2017, for bringing people together and almost creating
world peace. Of course there will always be people that envy successful
people like Tony Leondis, but we should all just dab on the haters to
let them know we do not f*ck around. I'm heavily looking forward to Mr.
Leondis' upcoming project, which is supposedly going to be featuring
fidget spinners. This man definitely knows how to save humanity.
