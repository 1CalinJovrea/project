Guillermo del Toro's wonderful fable  "my favourite thing I've ever
done"  is kind of like Arrival starring Amélie, as a shy, mute cleaner
(Sally Hawkins) at a government base begins to communicate with the
aquaman in the tank, and feels the first flickerings of love.Set  like my last film at the LFF, On Chesil Beach  in 1962, it's
really about today: a plea for tolerance in the light of Trump and co's
war on Muslims, blacks and gays, and a monster movie in which the
monster isn't the Other, it's right-wing, gung-ho America, represented
here by Michael Shannon, as a psychotic vet in a teal Cadillac who'll
beat the living crap out of anything that doesn't conform to his very
specific notion of a person. The toxic machismo and vicious hatred of
otherness isn't restricted to him, though, it's endemic: and hiding
behind the most benign of fronts.Shot in a rich, stylised palette of greens and browns (admittedly more
City of Lost Children), set partly above an old, working cinema and
filled with little visual effects  though with a creature who's
delightfully and resolutely real  it reminded me of nothing as much as
Amélie. That 2001 movie might be the last time I felt quite so charmed
by a lead character as by Hawkins' Eliza Esposito, whose increasingly
appealing, steely, sexy performance recalls that holy trinity of great
mute turns: Dorothy McGuire in The Spiral Staircase, Samantha Morton in
Sweet and Lowdown and Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda, and is just as full
of nobility and pathos; just as lacking in gimmickry.There's nice work too from Richard Jenkins, who is frequently held
hostage in underwhelming comedies, but showed in Tom McCarthy's 2007
masterpiece, The Visitor that he's just about the best actor in America
when he can be bothered. As Eliza's gay flatmate, a struggling,
alcoholic advertising artist, he's never self-pitying or trite, and
those traits no more define who he is than the fact he's bald.The plot is fine: diverting, involving and well-balanced between
moments of intrigue, suspense and humour, but it's the passages of
poetry that completely bewitched me, including one sequence in a
waterlogged bathroom that took the breath away.There's another beguiling flight of fancy that memorably references
Fred and Ginger's 'Let's Face the Music and Dance', and music is
critical to this film: Hawkins and Jenkins engage in an impromptu tap,
Alexandre Desplat equips her with the most enchanting theme, and del
Toro exhibits his great love for  and understanding of  classic
Hollywood by including several clips from old Fox musicals, including
Bojangles and Shirley Temple in The Little Colonel and colour clips of
Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda rendered in the monochrome of '60s tube
TV. Realising that I was in a cinema in which a modern audience was
being forced to watch old footage of Alice Faye, and listen to a short
monologue discoursing on her ill- fated Hollywood career was just the
most delightful thing.So a sci-fi, a horror, a monster movie, a romance, a Cold War
thriller, and a history lesson about Alice Faye: this genre-bender is
many things, but above all it's an emotional experience, a clear-
sighted, glowing-hearted picture with some of the most beautiful
imagery and a performance I'm going to be rhapsodising about for weeks,
months, years.
