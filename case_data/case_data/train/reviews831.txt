Very good movie with a great ending

Josh Duhamel was awesome in this movie. He played a sweet sensible guy
that was perfect for Julianne Hough. This movie had a great plot with
good romance combined with a mystery and drama. It was worth every
penny I spent on valentines day. The final 10 minutes was probably my
favorite part. It had a big twist that got me and has stuck with me
since i saw it. The writing was excellent as was the directing. It was
one of the better romance movies I have seen in a while. It was a
perfect valentine movie. When I went I really didn't think that.If you are looking for a romantic drama to spend with you wife/husband
look no further than Safe Haven.
