Good Suspense and Tension

Jill's (Amanda Seyfried) sister Molly is kidnapped as Jill was years
ago. Detective Powers (Daniel Sunjata) doesn't believe her as he didn't
believe her before because Jill could not come up with any viable
evidence that she was kidnapped and escaped. He believes it was all in
her head. Jill feels she cannot trust the police to help.At first I thought (and hoped) I would be seeing a female version of a
Mel Gibson character who knows no boundaries when a family member is
taken. I was wrong. We see Jill doing the detective work that the
police would normally do. She goes here and there and gathers clues
getting closer and closer to the serial-killer kidnapper. The police
are now in full pursuit of her because shots were fired and that is a
violation as she had been in a mental hospital and owning a gun is a no
no. This held me because the suspense and tension were very good. And,
what's not to like with Jill and those big Red Riding Hood eyes? (I
would guess Amanda Seyfried will be forever known for that.) The entire
cast performed well. Two things: Jill's road trip to the forest where she was kept years ago
has the story go full circle as we knew it would. We screamed and
begged for her not to go there, but she didn't listen. And, where Molly
was found was a bit of a stretch but for the twist to work it had to be
this way.However, all in all, this is pretty good even though you are convinced
a Mel Gibson character won't show up. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity; No. Language: No.
