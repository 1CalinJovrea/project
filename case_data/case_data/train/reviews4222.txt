The worse of the franchise!

*** This review may contain spoilers ***Totally waste your time and money.Paul W S Anderson think he is smart enough, using lot of stupid,
pointless & unnecessary action scenes to cover up the one page poor
script; Does it make the movie look exciting? Sorry! man! It doesn't
make the movie look exciting at all; in the matter of fact, It only
makes the movie bored to dead.By just one small bottle of anti-virus, immediately kill off millions
of zombie in just one second? Are you kidding me? Come on, man! It is
totally stupid story arrangement! yap.. not to mention another stupid
arrangement such as meet up the old friend, and Oh! We have a betrayer!
It's so Boring!!!!Alice come back to life again at the end, make her sacrifice totally a
joke. Paul W S Anderson keep the character alive, which means....? More
episode on the future..? Oh! God!
