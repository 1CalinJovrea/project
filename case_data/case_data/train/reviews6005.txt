Too Long, Boring, and Didn't Have a Real Ending....

I am going to make my review short, sweet, and to the point. Something
Magic Mike was not. As far as the stripping goes and the first hour of
the movie, it wasn't that bad. I actually had a good time. When the
movie got close to two hours, I along with everyone else in the theater
were ready to leave. That being said, I think the writer of the film
was also ready to leave... his computer from writing the script,
because there was NO ENDING... they kind of sum up two characters and
thats it.. for the rest of the cast you spend 2 hours getting to know
them, you have no idea if they die from too much crack or if they quit
dancing or if they have fun at a new club... there needed to be at
least a photo of each character with a small description of what
happened to them next... NOT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY... but one of the
main characters in the movie has a HUGE LIFE ISSUE, and they NEVER
SOLVE IT, they give you nothing... just "WELL THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE
HAPPY, THE END"
