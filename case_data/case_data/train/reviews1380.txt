Stone and Carell shine

BATTLE OF THE SEXES (2017) *** Emma Stone, Steve Carell, Andrea
Riseborough, Natalie Morales, Sarah Silverman, Pill Bullman, Alan
Cumming, Elisabeth Shue, Eric Christian Olsen, Fred Armisen, Jessica
McNamee. Stone and Carell shine as 1970s tennis aces Billie Jean King
and Bobby Riggs who took on the world of tennis (and the world at
large) in an iconic tennis match with the closeted lesbian fighting for
women's rights and the comical male chauvinistic pig attempting a
comeback after a series of setbacks. Filmmaking couple Jonathan Dayton
and Valerie Faris give a well-balanced effort in allowing their
protagonists to be well-rounded largely thanks to a smart screenplay by
Simon Beaufoy.
