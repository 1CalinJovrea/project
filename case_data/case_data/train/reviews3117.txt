Didn't Want It To End

The Cornetto series continues with nothing short of what you'd expect
from Wright, Pegg and Frost. Delivering top laughs with great action
and a little bit of romance to suit all audiences. The film's visual
style is quite appealing. The only downside to this film some may see
is that the gore is not traditional (being robots). The style of
violence in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz shine through with just a
bit of a blue tint. The characters are just plain lovable and hilarious
in their own ways. Most of the laughs in this film came straight from
dialogue of characters rather than visuals. All in all I thoroughly
enjoyed this film, a fun comedy with nothing to pick on whatsoever A
top film just like the others!
