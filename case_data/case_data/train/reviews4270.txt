Pine's a good choice, but the story's way undercooked

Can't sugarcoat it, this was a disappointment. SHADOW RECRUIT does a
pretty good job reimagining Clancy's hero for a post-9/11 world, but
it's also got a lackluster economic terrorism plot with a few
Bourne-esque fight scenes thrown in (you know the type: in-your-face
with a jittery hand-held camera). I'm a Chris Pine fan, and I liked
seeing his take on the role, and Costner's pretty good as the grizzled
mentor, but Branagh did not make for a good bad guy. He's got the
theater training to play up the menace, but it's not a well-written
part, and he wasn't all that dangerous.I'd like to see more with Pine in the role, as he can carry Jack Ryan
as action hero. Sadly, I don't think there's more in the pipeline.5/10
