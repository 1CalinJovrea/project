Left me with a lot of changed concepts of "clowns".

**Some spoilers are added to my review!** I never knew the origin of
clowns and was wondering if there is any actual fact to the version
this movie states? Overall it was a very good gore flick and the
premise was great. I have never been a fan of clowns and although I do
know they are just make-up and ridiculous costumes, they still gave me
an uneasy feeling. Now my whole concept has changed and I for one find
clowns a thing to look at with more of a "pondering" thought of what is
under their whole premise. I did however especially like the comic way
in which the suit is trying to be removed. It began as comical and
slowly moved to terror for the wife and son. Like others have said, the
transformation from a subtle dad in a clown suit to the final version
was very good. Slow and constant. It did keep me awaiting what was to
be next. The special effects were very well done and obviously a lot of
time went into the end results. Throughout the whole movie I was held
firm to my screen. A very good horror/gore film. It may have been a "B"
type movie, but it definitely surpassed this in many ways.
