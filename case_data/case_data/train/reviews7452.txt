What happen to good (drama) movies?

This movie sucks! tries to hard to be an special movie or something
artistic, the result is a COMPLETE FAIL, Two words: "boring" and
"shallow" like a lot of movies of this last couple of years. Maybe is
because of the influence of that trend called hipster, IDK, I miss
movies like Good Will Hunting, As Good as It Gets, etc. I am talking
about drama movies that delivers a lot of emotions. In this movie you
can hardly remember a great line or scene that stays in your head. Well
I hope that this kind of trend end soon and we began to see some
quality movies. Don't get me wrong I don't think that everything is bad
nowdays, for example in my opinion the movie "The Way Way Back", was a
pretty decent movie and I think that is in the same tone of this
"indie" "modern/retro" kind of movie, but WAY WAY BETTER THAN THIS
MOVIE "Me and Earl..."
