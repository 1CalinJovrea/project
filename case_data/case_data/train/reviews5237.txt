More questions than answers

This had the makings of a really GREAT Action,suspense and mystery
movie...The cinematography was excellent,the acting was very well done,
and there was lots of suspense. However,not enough was explained at the
movie's conclusion and you were left with way too many unanswered
questions! I am left longing for a complete explanation of the story
line! A much needed and decent synopsis would be great at this point. I
really did enjoy Dane De Haan's powerful performance. I was not
familiar with him or any of the other actors before this film. Jason
Isaac was very good as well,and Mia Goth reminded somewhat of Mia
Farrow in Rosemary's Baby.I find it very difficult to discuss this
strange movie without revealing spoilers, so I really cannot say much
more about it.
