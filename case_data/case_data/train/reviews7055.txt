Brilliant

The film is a lot different from the trailer. It's very good, brilliant
actually, fun and enjoyable but much darker. The film shows it as a
light weight,playful film, not as a psychotic man who needs to control
every small detail in his life including the woman he loves. It is
truly brilliant, but go in with an open mind, don't leave the trailer
to guide you through the film. I sound like I'm giving it a bad
impression. I don't mean to, I came out with my dad and I absolutely
loved it, we spent most of the journey home contemplating what we had
seen. And in all truths, I want the mum's house, and their water slide,
and more!
