Took me by surprise!

wow this was a total surprise. It borders on clich√© but then takes each
scene into unique territory that builds very interesting characters and
circumstances. It has its basic action set pieces but the story and
characters elevate this into something special. Story is told via
chapters (something like 7 of them) so its 3 act structure is revealed
in a fun and artistic way. Music and digital effects are top notch as
well. All in all I was taken back by how good it really is. And that
dog fight in the sky.... ohhh yes!
