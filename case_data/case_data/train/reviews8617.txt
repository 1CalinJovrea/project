Inside Out a Depressed Disney

I went to see this with my 6 year old and 12 year old and we all left
depressed and hating the movie. Disney needs to remember they are in
the "entertainment" business. This is the second movie they have made
lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were
before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but
sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes,
there is realism. But, I prefer the "fantasy" part of cartoons where
one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my
opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression
they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another
movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they
talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost
all of them. Am so sad that my kids can't have that same joy! This
movie was such a waste of talent and time!!! Save your money and watch
a DVD at home instead.
