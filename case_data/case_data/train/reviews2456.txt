Perfect Performances; Mesmerizing Story

Wasn't expecting this to be as amazing as it was.Downey's always good, but this was a Best Supporting Actor winner for
Robert Duvall. I can't tell you how good he was here. Vera was amazing
in the few scenes she was in as well. The story line was impeccable.
Everyone in the theater was mesmerized and stayed seated through the
credits...just not able to get up after such an emotional ride.The story is about a father and son and their coming together. A tear
jerker. Reminds you of your own life and the relationships in it. This
would be a great movie to see with your loved one. A few bad words, but
otherwise no violence or sex.It's an absolute 'don't miss'.
