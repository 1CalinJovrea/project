Rated good by part time movie watchers. Nothing on the original. Lacking in so many ways

As a movie it is OK but as a sequel to 300 it is insulting at best. As
soon as the movie begins the first thing you notice is its in full
colour and within a few minutes you realise that a lot of it has been
shot around the basis of 3d. I'm not a massive fan of 3d however i
don't mind it when it fits to the film whereas the film fits to the 3d
here instead. Gone is the slow motion beauty although it is attempted
it seriously falls flat. If that is not enough the huge army of Persia
is gone and instead the film is pretty much boat based which is dull at
best. The whole movie is contained in the trailer. The whole get from a
to b in a special way at the end was about as unbelievable as it gets.
The title is fully misleading as Spartans hardly appear at all except
for about two minutes and despite attempting to explain why a god-king
becomes a god-king there is no empire included in this movie save for
the few boats.If you enjoy action movies for something to watch this is OK it passes
the time. If however you find the original 300 stands apart for the
visuals and the fight scenes then do not waste your time you will be
disappointed. It is annoying to me that they used the 300 name which
made me want to watch it as it really was a average film at best
