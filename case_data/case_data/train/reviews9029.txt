Great movie, great acting from Jason Clarke

Great movie! In my view the cast was very important in the charms of
the movie. Jason Clarke was the perfect person for the role of Reinhard
Heydrich. The way he acts is giving you sympathy for the person he
play, meanwhile you don't want this sympathy feeling for this person.
This internal sense of feeling gives the film a continuous tension from
begin to end. In my view the abstract scene's always got some details
in it, this makes that no scene is boring to watch. I personally like
the movie build up, very well done.
