Mad Max fury road left me furious

first of all , i am not fond of writing reviews pertaining to movies
but this movie reluctantly compelled me to write a review for the first
time. So lets start,i had been desperately waiting for this movie since
long and today i got a chance to watch it and after watching it i was
left agape with incredulity that how a movie like this is being
applauded by the masses , Seriously it had nothing, except for
extraordinary nonsense action. This movie is devoid of a sane story but
in fact according to me it neither have a story nor a plot and
regretfully i have to say that this is the worst movie i have seen in
recent history. Mad max fury road is highly overrated and is mocking
other movies which have ratings between 8 and 8.7. Albeit, I am a huge
fan of Tom Hardy and Chalize Therone but their acting could not save it
from becoming a complete ruin. i am giving it a one point and seriously
if there had been an option to rate a movie below one point then i
would have given it much lower points. Its also a suggestion to IMDb
developers that they should ameliorate the movie rating algorithm and
incorporate an option that can rate movies below the current lowest
mark so that people should rate according to their aspirations. Finally
i am exhorting that do not watch this movie its a detestable and a
ridiculous movie.
