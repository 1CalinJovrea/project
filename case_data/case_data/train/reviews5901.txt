Fresh idea, poor execution

I'm going to try not to include spoilers but I marked it just in case.
I was able to see an early screening of this and I didn't have high
expectations. Which turned out to be good because it wasn't scary. This
is coming from an avid horror movie fan. The idea is interesting and
some parts were well done. It is similar to the found footage films or
paranormal activity where the action occurs through various forms of
technology. The humor is well placed and definitely geared towards
teenagers. I perceived the scary parts as humorous and found myself
laughing through most of it. Although, I was still thoroughly
entertained and suggest this to anyone who doesn't take it that
seriously as a horror film. Great film to see with your friends.
